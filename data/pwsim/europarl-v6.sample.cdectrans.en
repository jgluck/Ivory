 resumption of the session 
 i declare the resumed session of the european parliament on friday , 17 december for resumed once again to wish you a happy and hope that they had beautiful holidays . 
 as you have seen , the dreaded " millennium bug " not materialise . but the people of some of our member states become victims of terrible natural disasters . 
 there is the desire for a debate in parliament during this session in the next few days . 
 today i would like to ask you - and this is also the desire of some of my colleagues , all victims of the storms , particularly in the various countries of the european union , in observing a minute 's silence . 
 i ask you to observe a minute 's silence . 
 ( the parliament observed a minute 's silence ) . 
 madam president , on a point of order . 
 as i am sure you know from the press and television , there were several bomb explosions in sri lanka with numerous deaths . 
 to the people , in the recent time in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam , the european parliament had a visit only a few months ago . 
 it would be appropriate for you , madam , the regret of the parliament in a letter to the president of sri lanka to the violent death of mr ponnambalam and other citizens of sri lanka and urge you to do everything in your power , to seek a peaceful solution to this very difficult situation ? 
 yes , mr evans , i think that such an initiative would be entirely appropriate . 
 if the house agrees , i will follow the proposal by mr evans . 
 madam president , on a point of order . 
 could you give me any information in connection with article 143 of the inadmissibility ? 
 my question is a matter that will come up on thursday and i will raise again . 
 the parliament on thursday with the cunha report on multi - annual guidance programmes which , in paragraph 6 , that countries that fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually with a kind of quota penalties should be . 
 and although such penalties should be imposed despite the principle of relative stability . 
 i believe that the principle of relative stability is a basic principle of the common fisheries policy and undermine a proposal would be legally inadmissible . 
 i would like to know whether it is possible to raise an objection , which is only a report and no legislative proposal , and whether i am entitled to do so on thursday . 
 just then , if you want , you can address this issue , that is to say on thursday prior to the start of the debate on the report . 
 madam president . 
 this year 's first session of the european parliament , unfortunately , that in the united states , texas , on thursday the execution of a person sentenced to death this week 34jährigen young man called hicks has been set . 
 at the request of a french member , zimeray , has already been submitted a petition , which has been signed by many , including myself , is . 
 in accordance with the european parliament and by the whole of the european union now constantly the line however , i would like to ask you , the influence of their duties and the institution you represent , to the presidential candidate and governor of texas , george w. bush , to the suspension of execution and the pardon of the convicted person is empowered to exercise . 
 all this is in keeping with the principles , which we have always defended . 
 thank you very much , mr segni , i would like to do . 
 that is completely in line with the position we have always been represented in parliament . 
 madam president , i would like to draw your attention to a case that this parliament again . 
 this is the case of alexander nikitin . 
 we all of us here are pleased that the court also acquitted him and has made it clear that in russia of the access to information is a constitutional right . 
 but it is now so that he should be prosecuted again , because the public prosecutor is appealing . 
 we know , and we have it in very many entschliessungen said - during the last session of the last year , that this is not only a legal case , and that it is wrong , alexander nikitin crime and treason , because we , as affected by its results . 
 these results are the basis for the european programme to protect the barents sea , and that is why i ask you , outlines a draft letter setting out the most important facts , to examine and in line with the decisions of the parliament in russia to make this position clear . 
 elisabeth schroedter , i am willing to examine the facts , if i have received your letter . 
 first of all , thank you very much madam president , that you have kept your word , and now in the first session of the new year , the supply of television channels in our office is indeed increased considerably . 
 however , madam president , my wish has not been met . 
 we can now two finnish and one portuguese , there is still no dutch channel . i asked you but a dutch programme , because we want to dutch also follow the news , if we are to be sent into exile here every month . 
 therefore , i would like to ask you once again , to ensure that a dutch channel . 
 plooij - van gorsel , i can tell you that this point on the agenda of the bureau on wednesday . 
 i hope that there will be decided in mind . 
 madam , can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health , which it adopted ? 
 why the air quality was reviewed in this building since our choice is not a single time ? 
 so why is the arbeitsschutzausschuss met since 1998 , not a single time ? 
 why has neither in brussels nor in strassburger building a fire drill took place ? 
 why are there no fire instructions ? 
 why , after my accident , nothing was done to make the staircases ? 
 why are no - smoking areas not enforced ? 
 it is a shame that we adopt rules to keep it ourselves . 
 ms lynne , you are quite right , and i will check whether this is really the case . 
 i will also ask the quaestors . i am sure that this great value that we comply with the legislation that we adopt , themselves . 
 madam president , díez gonzalez and i had some questions to certain appeared in a spanish newspaper opinions of the vice - president , de palacio . 
 the services they have not included in the agenda , because they believe that they had been answered in a previous meeting . 
 i ask you to reconsider this decision , because this is not the case . 
 the unanswered questions previously referred to the occurrence of commissioner de palacio in a certain matter , not on 18 november of last year in the abc newspaper . 
 we will look into it . 
 i must tell you , however , that the situation seems to be somewhat confused at the moment . 
 but we will check very carefully , so everything is correct . 
 madam , i would like to know whether the parliament in this week is a clear signal of our discontent over today 's decision will be rejected , with the extension of the arms embargo against indonesia , will send , especially as the large majority in this parliament has voted for arms embargo on indonesia in the past . 
 today 's decision not to renew the embargo carries a very big risk in view of the situation . 
 the parliament should , because this is the wish of the big majority , send a message . 
 the rejection of the extension of the ban on the part of the eu member states is irresponsible . 
 as has been pointed out , is the unstable situation in indonesia äusserst . 
 there is even the possibility of a military coup . 
 we do not know what is happening . 
 so why should reap profits arms manufacturers in the eu at the expense of innocent people ? 
 so far , this point is not intended for the debate on thursday . 
 business 
 the next item on the agenda is the examination of the final version of the draft agenda as he under article 110 of the rules on thursday , 13 january set by the conference of presidents . 
 on monday and tuesday , there have been no changes . 
 on wednesday : 
 the socialist group in the european parliament has requested , a statement by the commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years , as well as the administrative reform of the commission to be included in the agenda . 
 i would like mr baron crespo , to justify its request , if he so wishes . 
 then we as usual procedure , a speaker for and one against . 
 madam president , the idea of the political programme of the prodi commission for the whole legislature was back on a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists , the unanimous approval of the conference of presidents in september and also was the explicit approval by president prodi , reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech . 
 this commitment is important , as the commission is a body , which according to the treaties the monopoly and thus essential this parliament 's political and legislative work in the next five years . 
 i would also like to remind you that this parliament has expressed its confidence in the previous legislature , president prodi twice ; in this legislature , his confidence again in july , and then , when the new commission was in office , it was a vote of confidence for the commission as a whole again in september . 
 therefore , the commission has already had enough time to prepare its programme , and we know it and to be able to explain to the citizens . 
 in this sense , i would like to remind you of the entschliessung by 15 september , which recommended that the present proposal in the shortest possible period . 
 the events of the last week , began on the fringes of the conference of presidents and this conference only to confirmation and ratification was used by decisions of the non - us with a dilemma : either the commission is not in a position to present this programme ( in this case it should clarify the matter . 
 according to its president , it is in a position to do so . 
 since the commission is represented by vice - president loyola de palacio , , i consider it zweckmässig , before the vote , the commission 's position on their readiness for the presentation of the programme , as it was agreed to know ) , or the parliament is not able to study this programme , as some appear to be set . 
 i believe that this second hypothesis an abdication of our responsibility as a parliament and would also raise the amount to an original these , an unknown method , the resources , the political groups , the keynote speaker of the commission in written form , and not , as agreed , a week before the day before to give - note in february , taking into account that the programme will be discussed on the debate , so that we could do without it , because the press and the internet all citizens would have informed the next day and no more reason for the parliament would have to deal with the matter . 
 because my group is of the opinion that a parliament is there to listen , discuss and reflect , in our view , there is no justification whatsoever for this delay , and we believe that , if the commission is in a position to do so , we are exactly at the time the original agreement between the parliament and the commission back into force and be responsible to our fellow citizens . 
 that is why the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists , which you have mentioned , is the wednesday as the deadline for the presentation of the prodi commission for the legislature , and in this programme also include the verwaltungsreformprojekt , otherwise we might in a paradoxical situation : with the excuse that the wording is not , on the one hand , the president of the commission denied the right to speak in this parliament , and on the other hand would be a debate on the reform , without that this parliament has previously been able to read the texts , the heart of the debate . 
 therefore , i ask you , madam president , to ask the commission , is now to voice , and then proceed to the vote . 
 ( the group ) 
 madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i am a little surprised by the behaviour of mr baron crespo , who is now demanding that this item will be put on the agenda for wednesday . 
 mr baron crespo , they could attend the conference of presidents last thursday . 
 i am not criticising ; it happens from time to time , that they be represented . 
 mr hänsch they represented . 
 we have an in - depth discussion in the conference of presidents . 
 only their group has represented what they say now . 
 we have voted . 
 every chairman or chairman has so many votes as the group has members . 
 it was a vote on this point . 
 as i recall , the outcome of this vote : 422 votes to 180 in a few abstentions . 
 this may , all the groups , with the exception of the non - but , of course , they are not a group - were in agreement , only their group was of the opinion , so , as you have proposed here . 
 all the others have disagreed . 
 this was the decision . 
 now i would like to say something to the matter . 
 we have confidence in the commission , romano prodi , and the large majority of our group has romano prodi and the commission after a difficult process , as everyone knows , the trust . 
 but we are also of the opinion that we have a debate on this strategy must lead the commission in an orderly process , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament , but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and describes this programme for five years . 
 such a document does not exist . 
 the commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in february . 
 we have said o. k , if the commission wants to make the programme has not yet in january 2000 , then we will do it in february . 
 we have agreed . 
 we want to quarrel with the commission , but we are of the opinion that if it is a common path , commission and parliament . 
 but we , as parliament , are also the controller of the commission , and not everything that comes from the commission , must be our opinion . 
 i would like us to a debate on the five - year programme in the groups can prepare properly . 
 you cannot prepare , if you hear a statement and even do not know what the content of such a declaration . 
 that is why it is our recommendation , and my impression is that the commission is also open to this idea , that in february the debate on the long - term programme we lead the commission until the year 2005 , i hope that the commission will agree on a programme until then , which they will propose to us , and that , at the same time , in february the debate about the commission 's legislative programme for the year 2000 . 
 it is therefore a reasonable connected , we should , to lead the debate on both programmes together . 
 therefore , my group rejects the proposal of the socialist group . 
 ( applause from the epp - ed group ) 
 i propose that we , on the request of the socialist group in the european parliament , the commission statement on its strategic objectives be put back on the agenda . 
 the parliament rejected the request ( from ) the president . 
 wednesday is i have another proposal on the oral question on the capital . 
 the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) group , this item from the agenda . 
 does anyone want to justify the request on behalf of the group ? 
 madam president , as i hear a bit of laughter from the socialists - said to me that was also keen to have this item taken off large sections of the socialist group , want the vote because the vote in the conference of presidents of the working group of the members of the socialist group did not apply . 
 i do not know whether this information is correct , but we as epp - ed group would be grateful if this point were removed because the parliament has already dealt with this issue several times . 
 there are also decisions against such a tax . 
 that is why my group , this item of the agenda . 
 thank you very much , mr poettering . 
 we now come to mr wurtz to speak against the motion . 
 madam president , first of all , i would like to point out that what mr poettering as saying that is not logical . 
 he lectured to a group of the party of european socialists because this is a very clear and unequivocal decision of the conference of presidents , and now he is doing exactly the same thing . 
 we have discussed , we agreed , not only the group of the european people 's party and the liberals . 
 and i still had pointed out that my fellow chairmen will recall remember that it is not a question , whether they are for or against the tobin tax , but whether we are prepared to listen to what the commission and the council of ministers . 
 it is not too much to ask . 
 i therefore repeat the proposal to maintain this question of the commission and the council , once and for all to hear the opinion of the two institutions on this relatively modest proposal , which would be an important signal to the public , particularly after the excitement in the wake of the failure of the seattle conference . 
 we will now vote on the request from the ppe - de - group , the oral question on the taxation of the agenda . 
 ( the parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions . ) 
 madam , i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate . 
 thank you very much . 
 madam president , is my vote has been counted ? 
 i was unable to vote electronically , because i do not have a card . 
 i was " in favour " . 
 in fact , if the two members who have declared themselves , as a result of ... 
 madam president , the presidency has announced the result of the vote . 
 the changes are not possible . 
 madam president , in the earlier vote on the question of the strategic plan of the commission - no fear that i will abide by their decision in this matter , i had asked to speak before the vote on behalf of my group . 
 it was not . 
 i would welcome it if i have the opportunity to conclude this item , on behalf of my group would make a statement on the vote . 
 this is an important matter . 
 it would be useful for the record , what we have just done by the individual in the light of their own political analysis . 
 madam president , i do not wish to resume the debate , but i had also been reported in order to respond to the request of mr baron crespo . 
 they have not called on me . 
 i regret it , but the vote has been carried out , the decision is made , so let the things . 
 i am sorry , herr and mr cox . 
 i had not seen that they had asked to speak . 
 but the positions are clear and will be recorded in the minutes . 
 if we can adopt the minutes of the meeting of today , tomorrow the ladies and gentlemen , believe that the positions are not sufficiently clear , asking for changes . 
 i think this is appropriate . 
 of course , the minutes of the meeting of tomorrow take into account all of the additional explanations . 
 i think this is better than now long explanations of vote . 
 mr cox , mr , do you agree with this ? 
 madam president , if the vote well , as my group has voted against it , then i shall not , and cannot say . 
 if you establish that i cannot give an explanation of vote , i accept it , but with reservations . 
 the wording of the protocol we will act with great care , which always do . 
 if positions are not correct , we cannot change the protocol , if necessary . 
 the parliament approved the amended ( business ) . 
 advisers for the transport of dangerous goods 
 the next item on the agenda is the report ( a5 - 0105 ) by koch / 1999 on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the common position of the council with a view to adopting a directive of the european parliament and the council on the minimum requirements for the verification of advisers for the transport of dangerous goods on streets , railways and waterways ( c5 - 0208 / / 0106 ( cod ) 1999 - 1998 ) . 
 commissioner , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i begrüsse the common position of the council on the harmonisation of the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods on streets , rail or binnenwasserstrasse straightforward . 
 firstly , we have had formal action in order to meet the requirements of the directive 96 / 35 / ec , the member states to set up gefahrgutbeauftragten or safety advisers and to organise training , education and examination of these people committed , without explicitly . 
 secondly , we get with this directive : a ) an increase in security , both in terms of transport as well as the transfer of dangerous goods ; ( b ) a removal of distortions as a result of all genuine national training structures and training and c ) the creation of equal opportunities of safety advisers on the european market . 
 thirdly , we guarantee with the directive , as it now stands in the common position , especially since it is ausschliesslich limited to minimum standards , a high degree of flexibility and low level of regulation by the european union , and we are contributing to the high responsibility of the member states . 
 all this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ausserordentlich to welcome . 
 our amendments from the first reading , i think , is very satisfactory . 
 they were taken , sinngemäss implemented or they accounted for , because the european regulations were not included , for example , a system of sanctions against those who infringe them or a complicated blockbildung of issues . 
 in a unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport , which concerns the timetable for implementation of the directive , i ask you to vote . 
 the member states for the implementation of the directive by not setting a specific date , but allow them a period of three months after the entry into force of the directive , we are introducing a flexibility clause to ensure immediate implementation . 
 i ask you to support it . 
 madam president , we cannot and must not resign ourselves , increasingly hear of accidents , in which , on the streets , but also on the railways or waterways big damage , not only , but also because the affected the transit of dangerous goods not seriously enough or because of ignorance or lack of training of drivers or other responsible for the various means of transport from a small accident has too often become a major disaster . 
 me as an austrian , but i think all of us is still the disaster in living memory , which last year in the tauern tunnel has cost many lives and where anschliessend had to be rebuilt with continued financial burden for many months , was destroyed in the fire in the tunnel . 
 the renovation has cut off this important route between the north and the south of europe . 
 the result stretched has many thousands of eu citizens to the border . 
 it was really the hell in individual communities in my country . 
 prevention must be our response to such disasters , and the draft is an important basis for that well - trained safety advisers being available , so that time did the right thing . 
 but we must not be content with european law to create more security . 
 we also need to follow to ensure that our rules be transposed by member states , and more importantly , we must ensure that they anschliessend also applied . 
 please do not yet another area in which we then anschliessend lament the lack . 
 one last point i would like to mention that we must not be content , a further gap in safety net schliessen and eyes to verschliessen , that there is still much more to do with the issue of road safety in europe . 
 in this context , i also ask the commissioner responsible , present a text as soon as possible , in order to ensure greater security in tunnelverkehr , also in the future so that we in europe must not see more in this extent such disasters . 
 madam president , first of all , i would like to thank mr koch for his report , the issue of transport safety . 
 the report deals with the harmonisation of requirements for security adviser , in the field of transport of dangerous goods on streets , rail or binnenwasserstrasse . 
 i would like to congratulate him on his excellent report . 
 the road safety certain often the bad publicity in recent times : the paddington rail crash in london , the terrible train accident in norway , the two plane crashes , in which eu citizens to damage and the natural disaster caused by the erika off the coast of brittany are events that were recorded in the last four months alone . they make it clear that safety should not be taken for granted , and that those who are responsible for the protection of the public , must be highly motivated and skilled . 
 the rapporteur noted that the council in its common position six of the ten has adopted the amendments approved by the parliament in the first reading and that other changes to the parliament are essentially have been taken into account . 
 my group will therefore support the common position and begrüsst the speedy implementation of the scheme , yet another tool in the fight to make the maximum increase of road safety in the eu . 
 my group will always support initiatives to increase safety . 
 as the recent events show , there is still much to be done in this area . 
 madam president , allow me to make a few observations . 
 i would like to thank both the rapporteur for his very meticulous and expert report and the commission 's proposals for her . 
 it is about the approximation of the exams , but also the minimum standards . 
 in a sense , i regret this . 
 of course , safety on streets , railways or waterways very big importance and it is necessary given the international nature of these shipments , the training for safety and to harmonize the requirements of the new adr , for example . 
 i think that as well as the implementation of important . of course , there are good reasons why we must pay special attention to this problem . 
 think of the accidents that have occurred in recent years in strassenverkehr . for example , in belgium , the netherlands and other countries where gefahrguttransporter despite fog and were not , as it actually would have been required on strassenrand , given the circumstances . 
 or remember schiffer of eastern european vessels over here and obviously risks . 
 furthermore , show controls in belgium , finland , as well as in japanese ports , that 50 % of the container with hazardous cargo not ordnungsgemäss be delivered . 
 in short , there is a serious problem . 
 what is the security adviser , so in some countries since 1 january this year , a consultant in the companies . 
 the implementation is at present , especially in small enterprises with difficulties , because they cannot afford a such a body . 
 they either have to sell their cargo or mixing it with other cargo , which leads to a number of problems . 
 therefore , the collection of these activities in the form of annual reports or certificates and possibly the inclusion in the certification under iso 9002 . 
 the real work is done , now it is the implementation . 
 allow me to make a final point . 
 in view of this implementation , we must furthermore appropriate agreements with eastern european countries because they only from july 1 , 2001 , also in a year and a half , will join the convention . 
 this age you temporarily competitive advantages . 
 in particular , although i think that in itself is not bad , we should give priority to the safety aspects of goods transported strasse , rail and waterways , this part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the candidate countries . 
 madam president , parliament regelmässig deals with the right to safety . 
 the ever increasing volume of transported goods passing through europe , open or hidden poses a threat to the personal and the society . 
 people who are facing this danger , therefore , have to meet high standards . 
 with the in another directive , 95 / 35 / ec standards enshrined , people should responsibly on the transport of dangerous goods can be discussed . 
 i am glad that there is also agreement with the council on minimum standards for testing , although i with the objective international equivalent qualifications single would have preferred binding rules and regulations . 
 this , however , does not seem to be feasible . 
 all in all , i think that the amendment tabled by the rapporteur in every respect is logical and can therefore fully support him . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports , perhaps the technical reports , but for the safety of very great importance . 
 i would just like to make a few comments . 
 first of all , i would like to ask the commissioner - and i am sure that my desire to fertile soil , that the issue of security , whether on the streets , on the waterways or at sea , more attention . 
 when i see that the commission 's first request was made on 19 march 1998 and today that we are dealing with the parliament reacted relatively quickly , then this is the period too long . 
 this is not just the fault of the commission , but i believe that we must respond more quickly to here to achieve harmonisation . 
 the second point has already been mentioned : the minimum standards . 
 in principle , i believe that we should seek greater flexibility in many sectors and country - specific rules . 
 i am rather sceptical on security , because security in sweden , for example , is in principle is not different from that in germany , italy or austria . 
 i can live with these minimum standards , but i would like to ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully . 
 if this kind of flexibility should lead to inadequate regulations in some countries , we should make a further harmonization . 
 the third point was also mentioned . 
 like the rack i come from a transit country , where this issue has a particular role to play . 
 we do not want the conditions worse for some countries unilaterally and for countries such as austria or other transit countries improve . 
 but i believe that we should do everything possible to ensure the transport of dangerous goods to keep as low as possible , and in all countries , whether or not transit . 
 mr president , first of all , i would like the rapporteur , mr koch , to his great work and its constructive cooperation with the commission of the improvement of the texts , the presentation of this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only an amendment to the requirements for the exams for advisers for the transport of dangerous goods on streets , railways and waterways . 
 in our view , the cooperation , the joint work of the two institutions , the parliament and the commission , it is important , and the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy , specifically with the group for transport , is excellent . 
 the common position practically all the amendments accepted by the commission , harmonises the minimum requirements of the tests for the advisers , and in the second reading , we can accept the proposed amendment to the date , which is much more realistic than the initially proposed by the commission , given that we have been discussing this issue for several years . 
 very briefly , i would also like to thank the various members for the contributions and say to you , ladies and gentlemen , that the commission gives priority to the security in the transport sector . 
 and as mr simpson has said very correctly , the process must never be considered as completed , as won or completed . 
 the process of increasing the safety margins and safety guarantees in the transport industry is a process that needs to be improved day by day . 
 in this context , i would also like to dwell very briefly on the problems of the tunnels , which raised the rack and swoboda , which , in the case of austria , without a doubt , be a very sensitive issue , and efforts must be made in order to find ways to increase security . 
 one of the major accidents in recent times was not dangerous in themselves . 
 the margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not risk , caused a real disaster . 
 therefore , it should be checked , such as the requirements to ensure the maximum degree of safety can be further improved . 
 abschliessend , i would like to say that it comes to the security of all modes of transport . 
 this week , we are here because of the erika disaster a debate on the safety of maritime traffic , and we must also discuss the safety of air transport in the course of this year . 
 i would like to express that safety is a priority for the commission . 
 as i will say in the debate on the erika , we are not waiting for a disaster , to deal with the question of safety , but we are working on the fringes of this type of events . this lead us the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem . 
 i would like to once again , all the speakers , and , in particular , the rapporteur , mr koch , say thank you . 
 the debate is closed . 
 the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . 
 the transport of dangerous goods on the streets 
 the next item on the agenda is the report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 ) by koch , on behalf of the committee for regional policy , transport and tourism for a directive of the european parliament and the council ( com ) 158 ( 1999 - c5 - 0004 / / 0083 ( cod ) 1999 - 1999 ) to change the directive 94 / 55 for the harmonization of the laws of the member states for the transport of dangerous goods on the streets . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , entered into force on 1 january 1997 directive on the approximation of laws of the member states for dangerous goods on the streets involves some transitional arrangements , whose validity and the completion of certain work the cen , also of the european committee for standardisation , is linked . 
 delays in the work of the cen now to problems in application this directive . 
 in particular , annexes cannot be adapted according to the technical and industrial development . 
 i regret this , because we need to act , because others have not done their job . 
 in this respect , i accept this and today to debate the proposal to change the directive 94 / 55 . 
 should the european union member states would commit to their national legislation for a short period of time , until the conclusion of the work of the cen , to change what caused unnecessary costs and uncertainty . 
 the amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not change the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community . 
 it extends only transitional rules by the postpone of deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and regulates the procedures for a ) ad hoc carriage of dangerous goods , and b ) adopting a less stringent national rules , in particular in the transport of very small amounts to strictly limited local areas . 
 thus the amendment to the directive is quite in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , the member states are given more powers . 
 the eu commission to decide whether member states can impose certain rules of their own . 
 they will be supported by a committee for dangerous goods after the procedure . 
 the procedures for the exercise of these powers the commission have been regulated by the council in june 1999 . 
 the proposal under discussion today for an amendment to the directive on the transport of dangerous goods on the streets by may 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the current procedure . 
 the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee in two cases relate to this modified procedure . 
 we want to make sure that this already formulated in the preamble and the unclear period within which the council must make a decision , to a maximum of three months . 
 in addition , the need for greater transparency . 
 another amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements , particularly for vakuumtanks , if priority in temperatures well below minus 20º c worked or transported . 
 this is in the special interest of northern european regions . 
 a final amendment is intended to ensure that the use of between 1 january 1997 tanks and tankers put into service in operation and the entry into force of this directive is allowed to continue , if they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with . 
 however , knowing that this is only a small step towards greater road safety , i ask you to agree to this report . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , 
 i wish you a happy new year and millennium . i am speaking for the first time in the house , and i think this is very exciting for me , a little like first love , only that the usually takes more than two minutes . 
 i would like the commission 's proposal to change the directive on the transport of dangerous goods to comment on the streets , from my point of view . 
 i think it is good that this directive now , because otherwise the member states to change their legislation for a very short period of time , a transitional period which would cause unnecessary costs on the one hand and , on the other hand , once again would anger in the citizens about the eu bureaucracy . 
 the commission 's proposal , however , does not take into account all the relevant issues , such as the cold climatic conditions in the northern regions . 
 this is why i have some amendments to the principle excellent report tabled by mr koch , which have been adopted by our committee . 
 my amendments concerning the frost - resistance ratings for dangerous goods . 
 according to the commission 's proposal would be a limit of -20 degrees enough . 
 on the shores of the mediterranean , it is difficult to imagine that in lapland significantly lower temperatures . 
 the eu in lapland , so that we must also think about the people here . 
 that is why i have proposed that the threshold for frost to -40 degrees lower . 
 this would be necessary , to maintain the level of security in the northern regions . 
 i hope that my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow 's vote . 
 mr president , if you would allow me , i would like to express my respect for you , as you have taken place earlier during the debate the quick changeover of the chairmanship . 
 i found it very well . 
 the subject : i think that the people of europe must be able to rely on , that was transported on europe 's streets seemed will , if it still dangerous goods , is as safe as possible . 
 this is a contribution to this directive . 
 what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance . 
 the rapporteur koch , whom we thank for the work he has done on this , who pointed out that basically everything could be somewhat further , if it is not this failure of cen , which are very dilatory in preparing and adapting the directive . 
 that is why we can only hope , and we should all beschliessen - this week , that in 2001 , we will finally have common rules for the transport of dangerous goods on the streets , so that we have a piece of legal certainty here and also have a bit more security on our streets . 
 mr president ! 
 the report , we are discussing today has basically no big changes , since most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical in nature . 
 however , it should be stressed that such decisions always make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment and improve the conditions for functioning of the internal market . 
 in the eu , large quantities of dangerous goods on the streets , rail and waterway , and for that we need effective legislation . 
 now we get for all possible areas of common minimum standards for the member states , was ausserordentlich begrüssenswert . 
 the rapporteur , therefore , i would like to thank mr koch , for his work on this issue . 
 it is also important for the conditions of the internal market . 
 for a truly functioning of the common transport market , we need not only legislation per se , but as far as possible , uniform rules . 
 let me comment on abschliessend a third point , i also feel that it is very important : the amendment by ari vatanen . 
 the conditions in the individual member states are very different . 
 with the adoption of this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union . 
 the effects of the cold on material and packaging must not be left aside eight . 
 mr president , i see it as a positive that this regime can be flexible and hope the commission will accept this amendment . 
 mr president , i would like to not only thank the mr koch , but also the vice - president of the commission , that they so clearly and unambiguously to safety in the transport sector and priority of security has known . 
 mr koch has made its good report , because in cen and also within the framework of the united nations economic commission the work not so expeditiv was made . 
 i would like to ask the vice - president , whether it can tell us today , as the state of things in the harmonization of these two organisations , and whether the eu has the opportunity to speed up the joker in the pack principles that are as simple as possible . 
 because it is clear : even if we an excellent arrangement within the european union , the transport does not stop at these borders , it goes beyond that . 
 therefore , further , reaching regional regulations are certainly makes sense . 
 if the commissioner cannot make it today , it would be prepared to the committee in writing the state of things and the state of the negotiations between the cen and to convey ? 
 mr president , i would like mr koch once again for his work on the other report , to a certain extent , the debate in october on rail transport . 
 we all regret that the european committee for standardization ( ecs ) is not been able in the required time to carry out the necessary for a harmonization within the european union . 
 the amendment to the current directive this debate and allow us to take account of different realities , reflecting the diversity of our europe . 
 mr vatanen spoke of temperatures , not just below 20 degrees below zero , but under 40 degrees below zero . 
 of course , we accept this amendment , it is entirely reasonable concrete situations , and i believe it must be taken into account , the witnesses , sometimes by the climatic diversity of the european union in the review of the technical standards and characterisations in specific rules and specific requirements are implemented . 
 the words of mr swoboda about the activity of the cen , i would like to say that we are urging them to speed up their work , because it would be tragic if , despite the new deadline would be little more than a year before the same difficulties , because the work has not been completed . 
 schliesslich , mr president , outlined the main problems which justify this amendment to the directive , we are on the delay by the cen , the amendment of some provisions , the agreement between the wording of the directive and the content of the annexes and referred to the need for a more specific . 
 all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , mr koch , which expressed in various amendments , specifically in four , will be taken up by the commission . 
 we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed . 
 the debate is closed . 
 the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . 
 coordination structural funds and cohesion fund 
 the next item on the agenda is the report ( a5 - 0108 / 1999 ) by elisabeth schroedter , on behalf of the committee for regional policy , transport and tourism on the communication from the commission : the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund - guidelines for programmes in the period 2000 to 2006 ( com ) 344 ( 1999 - c5 - 0122 / / 2127 ( cos ) 1999 - 1999 ) . 
 mr president , i am particularly pleased that my first speech in the european parliament is an issue in the part of the united kingdom , which i represent in this parliament , wales , as the most important issue at all . 
 as you know , has been a major part of wales ( programme the objective 1 status . 
 and so many people in wales , also expect that the european structural funds to alleviate some of the enormous difficulties , with which we have to fight without doubt helps . 
 the poverty in wales is continuing to increase , since 1997 . 
 the gap between the rich and the poor is becoming deeper . 
 therefore , we hope the programme is not only an economic restructuring , but a broader improvement of the economic basis of the part . 
 what we find it difficult to create power , however , is the fact that the granting of support within the framework of the structural funds , in a way , because of the success of the government . 
 it is yet another expression of the immense difficulties , wales faces . 
 therefore , i would like to draw your attention to some problems , which the commission should as a matter of priority . 
 we expect the commission that it pays more attention to problems in connection with the additionality . 
 we believe it is wrong for the corresponding figures in some way in the figures for the united kingdom . 
 we expect the commission , that there is a supplementary funding for the projects . 
 we expect that the british government , to ensure that the private sector , which is without doubt the driving force in terms of the provision of the structural funds , is involved in the planning stage . 
 schliesslich , we ask the commission to ensure greater transparency in the issuance of structural fund monies are spent . 
 too much of what is happening in this parliament , there is a lack of transparency . 
 this is an area in which the commission , i believe , may prove to be a true friend of wales . 
 mr president , our committee discussed the issues from many different angles . 
 first of all , i would like me to forschungsaspekt voice . we see it as a very positive sign that the rapporteur our committee 's proposal has included in its conclusions , that must be extended in the cohesion of the scientific infrastructure by universities and colleges in such places will be created , which are better than they have so far been available to the inhabitants of underdeveloped regions , and make it easier to stay in their home regions . 
 the government measures will enable , and such decentralisation of higher education is almost a sensible policy for a balanced development . 
 in a another question , we want to draw particular attention from the point of view of industrial policy , we would have liked that the commission in planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion , the effects of the growth of the service sector , electronic commerce and the use of the internet more had been taken into account . 
 poverty and wealth once more of the economic structure . 
 the rich were those regions where there were jobs in the industry and are now from these regions and poor areas where , meaning also needs to be invested in new industries such as electronics and services , as this future . 
 this , in my opinion , the main committee has not adequately addressed its report , so that i would like to point out to the commission on behalf of the industry . 
 as the committee on energy , we schliesslich would have liked that the promotion of renewable energy from the cohesion and structural funds have played an even higher role . in this way , through coordination , increasing the use of renewable energy sources can be developed so that a lack of funding the energy programme by these more substantial funds will be compensated . 
 mr president , i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for her to work in this issue . at the same time , i would like to say that i am speaking on behalf of my colleague , mrs flautre , the opinion on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs has produced and unfortunately is unwell . 
 i would like to draw your attention to the nos 1 and 2 , presented by the committee for employment and social affairs , but were rejected by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism . 
 it is about the economy and the need for the provision of " social risk capital " and the financial support of local programmes to create employment opportunities and strengthening social cohesion . 
 the parliament was an important potential providers of employment in the economy . 
 the amendments are in line with the opinion expressed by the parliament that social exclusion is a serious problem , the constructive measures requires . 
 we hope that those who consider rejection of these amendments , both the parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment can give good reasons for its decision . 
 in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to a field , stark lack of coordination , although here is sorely lacking . 
 the commission 's proposals relate to the four pillars of the strategy and the five areas of the european social fund . 
 but the lack of specific guidelines is to be regretted , as the idea of linking the esf - intervention with the employment strategy , in the period from 2000 to 2006 will be put into effect for the first time . 
 this gives the impression that the commission do not know failure , such as a possible comprehensive coordination between the esf - intervention , subject to review after three and a half years , and the annual national action plans for the employment of the member states . 
 we hope that we can convince the commission that it is merely an oversight corrected as soon as possible . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal put forward by the commission in fulfilling its mandate is a good starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development . 
 i would like to point out , however , that this starting point highlights the challenges facing us : in the light of the changes in all types of economic activity as a result of the declining importance of agricultural sector within the various sources of income for rural society to keep the population in rural areas . 
 together with the shortcomings in the infrastructure and services and a generally very low level of employment , strong seasonal and little they increase the exodus from rural areas . 
 the consequences are not waiting . 
 the young people who are disappearing , who are finding , training and employment outside the rural areas in these regions , was a very adverse impact . 
 this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs . 
 we must remember that the rural areas accounts for almost four - fifths of the territory of the european union . 
 the agriculture is only 5.5 % of the jobs in the union . 
 in addition , three - quarters of our farmers are nebenerwerbslandwirte and rely on additional sources of income . 
 for this reason , it is one of the most important and most far - reaching objectives , we should ask ourselves in the european union , efforts to create new jobs in the rural areas outside of the agricultural sector , including in the areas of rural tourism , sport , culture , the restoration of resources and the conversion of companies , new technologies , services and so on but , although the agriculture no longer plays ausschliessliche role , it is still important , not only to the economic and social decline of rural areas and to prevent the emergence of another ghost , but also because the farmers a fundamental role in the management of the territory , the preservation of biodiversity and the environment . 
 therefore , we are for an agricultural and rural development , which is consistent with our objectives , and that the rural areas , on the threshold of the 21st century must be competitive and multi - functional , both in terms of the agricultural aspect as well as the opening up to the diversity of non - agricultural activities . 
 it is important to general criteria of priority attention to planning and balanced population and to take into account the conclusions , which the committee for agriculture and rural development in the five main aspects , the only part of the committee for regional policy , transport and tourism in its points taken up 16 and 17 . 
 abschliessend i would like to ask the commission , these five points into account in the formulation of the conclusions of the four pillars , because i believe that the pegging of the population to the rural areas constitute one of the main goals of the european union . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to express my speech to thank mrs schroedter , the rapporteur for the work . 
 i think it is a very good work . 
 furthermore , i would like for her willingness to engage in dialogue with the other groups in search of formulas in the face of this avalanche of amendments ; perhaps it was greater than expected , but they actually dealt with the importance of this report . 
 it is important for us that this parliament endorsed the conclusions of the commission , at least , by their nature , are taken into account , because at this stage , it might look as if we are here is a useless exercise , purely hot air . 
 however , we believe , and this is also shown in the conclusions that the commission must consider the decisions of this parliament , especially in regard to the mid - term review of these guidelines . 
 in our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies between the structural and cohesion funds and community initiatives , so that its application to the best and most cost - effective way in the gradual elimination of regional disparities and reflected in the creation of jobs , in the end , the two main objectives of the fund . 
 in order to give a rapid and effective boost to the achievement of these goals , we consider it necessary that the entrepreneurs , that those who create jobs , the real entrepreneurial and guarantee new sources , in fact , be involved in this initiative . 
 the small and medium - sized enterprises in particular need to be involved in the distribution of these funds . 
 on the other hand , if the entrepreneurs feel marginalized , if they are not able to participate , i say now , not only in the administration , but also in receiving these funds , we will have lost an opportunity to attain our objectives . 
 also important for achieving our goals , to overcome the disparities between regions and for erschliessung of jobs is the determination of the new technologies , for the transport and communication networks and for renewable energy sources . 
 and all this - with the participation of the private sector , the united their efforts with those of the public administration , so that they can complement and not obstructing or ausschliessen creates social wealth and jobs . 
 mr president , i feel it is my duty to remind my colleagues mr evans , why wales to any objective - 1 has been declared . 
 this is the result of the dubious policy of his party , the conservatives . 
 may i also remind him that the chairman of his party , mr hague , when he was still secretary of state for wales , has broken all the rules in relation to the additionality , can violate the man only , and that was called to order by commissioner wulf - mathies . 
 i can assure you that the british government is aware that the aim - 1 the principle of additionality . 
 i propose that mr evans once again with the regulation . 
 my group has extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today . 
 i think we should focus on the central role of the guidelines . 
 it is to create a framework and tools , in order to support and promote the economic renewal , the resources and as effectively as possible , involving as many as possible partners to use and the regions concerned to pave the way for economic recovery and sustainable development , so that these schliesslich by support machine . 
 we must find out what skills and potential of our regions in the high - tech sector . 
 this is in view of reports in the media that europe in the hi - tech growth losing ground compared with the united states more and more particularly important . 
 the implementation of the last cycle is also very instructive , as it shows what the guidelines should not go . 
 it should not go about to build new bureaucratic obstacles . 
 it should not be that halfway through changes to the priorities and policies , which inevitably leads to delays and underutilisation of resources . this is especially important in view of the new requirements on budgetary discipline . 
 the implementation of the personal interpretation and implementation of the guidelines can not by this or that officials in the commission or the state be left . 
 within the directorate of the commission is to ensure uniformity , while at the same time to take into account the specific local and regional aspects of the commission . 
 this shows that we must strive for broad , indicative guidelines and flexible , to which both our programme - managers and support the beneficiaries and to get a maximum erschliessung the potential of the new areas of economic renewal . 
 if we manage to boost the business done in our poor and vulnerable regions , schliesslich , we will be able to consolidate the tax massgeblich herumreissen and the confidence of investors . it is nothing more in the way of a successful development . 
 the success of these guidelines will be to judge whether the eu regional policy , based on a good , sound and enforceable guidelines , succeed , new opportunities to erschliessen and how , that our poor and vulnerable regions can make a major contribution to growth and prosperity in the eu . 
 mr president ! 
 commissioner . 
 ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mrs schroedter sound , for the report . 
 it has been studying the issue and during the discussion in the committee report before many of the amendments that have been taken into account . 
 the rapporteur also rightly note that parliament was not heard in time to the guidelines . 
 now we are far behind schedule . 
 it is to be hoped that the opinions of the parliament and in the mid - term review for the practical implementation still use . 
 was the timing , the report during the treatment to extensive , with details and issues were already contained in previous reports . 
 at this stage , we have to focus on how the union 's regional policy can be drawn with this process , and in terms of the aim is to reduce regional disparities . 
 our group stresses the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of member states and the role of the regional partners in the development and implementation of the programme . 
 for äusserst important we , the small and medium - sized enterprises in the planning and implementation of the programmes . 
 also , our group supports a greater account of the overseas regions and other areas in regions and would like to develop the interaction between city and country . 
 we are against an excessive patronised by the union and the central administrations of the member states and call for the reduction of red tape in the drafting and implementation of the programme . 
 the success of the projects to be implemented with the help of the union , is often affected by slow decision - making and complicated administrative procedures . 
 in preparing the report , there was a lively debate on the union 's regional policy in general . 
 for new members , it was the first time , and i see a äusserst interesting process . 
 this report is very good and our group supports him . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome the phase of a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report of my colleague elisabeth schroedter could not reach the plenary session because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 to 2006 for the goal - regions have been sitting in the commission 's offices for several months . 
 in light of this , we must in this parliament to demand that the community support framework for the period in question in this parliament before its adoption be studied and , on the basis of the guidelines that we present today , because we think they are particularly suited to creating jobs in the poorest and least developed regions , and so we are helping to counter the negative , to inequality leading tendencies in the european society , so that we come up with a fairer europe . 
 mr president , we should not forget that the most important strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and their coordination in the achievement of economic and social cohesion . 
 it is our duty to participate in the drafting of the guidelines and also to participate in the evaluation of the results . 
 because we are the representatives of the citizens in the europe of the citizens and not just in a europe of states and regions . 
 we note that the fund is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the economic and social cohesion . 
 the gross domestic product per inhabitant , if we as the only indicator we might . 
 some members have already talked about unemployment and the decline . 
 it must be examined a number of indicators that will enable us to see the stand , and the development of regional societies , which are in a worse situation than others . 
 some of the reports at the plenary session of the parliament today is clear , that the unemployment in the 25 most developed european regions only accounts for one - fifth of the unemployment in the 25 least developed regions . 
 this means that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission to act decisively and strategically . 
 i also agree that the european parliament has given had no opportunity or not because the term came to an end , to discuss the guidelines . 
 but i do not believe that the report has come too late . 
 we need a common reflection , so that the new objective - 1 and the regional development plans , which have been drafted before the execution of the guidelines are subject to revision and proper assessment can be . 
 it is necessary to coordinate the programmes of the various objectives . we are all united in demanding that the parliament after the half of the halfway through this programme , when the assessment of the guidelines , a major role , because we are the representatives of the people . 
 the citizens can not accept that the european union makes decisions in a way , at least seemingly , bureaucratic . 
 it is necessary that the political dimension working for them , that responsibility , that there is a communication with the citizens . 
 this is what we are today asking the commissioner . 
 i think he will , on the basis of his previous experience as president of a region , agree that indicators and a strategy for the economic and social cohesion and not only be proposed for productivity . 
 mr president , i support the main proposals of the report on the administration of the structural and cohesion funds for the period 2000 to 2006 and the most important of the recommendations contained in the report . this includes , among other things , that at a uniform approach to the use of eu structural and cohesion funds . 
 this means that local authorities and national governments must closely and cooperate in the use of these funds . 
 the member states are urged to develop integrated strategies to revive the relations between urban and rural areas more importance , and it comes to the rural areas in particular . 
 even if the renewal of our cities is very important , in our policy , we must always strike a balance between promoting rural development and improving the living conditions of city dwellers . 
 we do not want to build a europe of the cities alone . 
 the structural funds , in particular through the modernisation of the streets , water treatment and the respective massgeblich networks for the development of rural and urban areas in the eu countries in regions . 
 this process is in line with the eu heads of state and government at their summit in berlin last year spending guidelines , which parliament has agreed at its may continue . 
 the most important of the eu from 1989 to 1993 , 1994 and 1999 programmes have very much to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and regions in europe . 
 it is now time to consolidate what has been achieved so far , and for the long term . 
 this would ensure that the countries in the regions and the regions in äusserster regions , the poorest regions in europe , the possibility of success in the new euro currency zone , as well as on a further expanding and marked by a free movement of goods , persons , services and capital market to operate . 
 although important infrastructure projects from the european regional development fund and the fund has been promoted , but we should not forget that the european social fund to make a very significant contribution to helping the less wealthy citizens of our society has done . 
 so he has to improve the facilities of the third , to financing of the school downstream ausbildungsmassnahmen and contributed to the creation of a comprehensive programmes to combat youth unemployment and long - term unemployment , the support of young people who leave school , and the combating of adult literacy . 
 mr president , i was so far in terms of regional approaches often disagree with the rapporteur , but this time i agree with her . 
 perhaps it will be encouraged to continue to work in this direction , but in any case , i would like to express my congratulations . 
 secondly , we would have preferred it if the guidelines of the regulation would have been annexed , as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteur for the general regulation , had asked . 
 unfortunately , this did not happen , however , was not mr bernie , but the old commission . 
 i am only to talk about , because i wanted to clarify the position of the parliament . 
 thirdly , i would like to say that we are satisfied with the guidelines in the big and large , as they do not deviate from our comments . 
 it is an essential tool for member states . i would like to emphasise that the commission of sustainable development , the creation of jobs , particularly with regard to the equal opportunities and the problem a high priority . 
 i fully agree with at least personally . 
 as an islander critical , however , i would like to say that the development of the islands in its importance . 
 - once again - not given the necessary attention to this point : that is now all the five years that i am a member of parliament , and again i have to draw attention to the problem . 
 we will also be no calm , because article 158 ( 1 ) of the treaty of amsterdam is a comprehensive policy for the islands . 
 the commission also must address this issue once and for all . 
 in addition , it is really time to implement the programme , and so the member states must also fulfil their responsibilities and do their homework . 
 what concerns us here in parliament , so i would like to refer to the code of conduct commission and parliament approved in may . 
 i am firmly convinced that this code and the parliament about all the developments and details in relation to the implementation of the programmes to be kept informed . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my one and a half minutes i would first like to congratulate our mrs schroedter . 
 many have already done so , but i think it has really deserves it , because it has a very open and other suggestions and shown , and i believe that this reflected in the quality of their report . 
 as the rapporteur , i regret that the parliament in relation to the guidelines quasi sailing on the bandwagon , as the negotiations with the states is so far advanced that we cannot assume that this report will have an immediate impact . 
 therefore , i believe that it is necessary that the parliament vorausdenkt and guidelines for the review of the half of the period in 2003 , and still try to influence the second phase from 2003 . 
 i mean , that we are at the beginning of the period 2000 to 2006 , the light of two big challenges must not be regarded as a routine matter . 
 the first challenge is the harmonization of national development policies and regional development policies . 
 subsidies are not enough for a development , in the absence of infrastructure and public services . 
 we are also against the fundamental question of how we a bite of the union 's policies with the subsidiary national planning policies can achieve . 
 the second challenge is the enlargement , of course , both in geographical as well as in budgetary terms , will have a considerable impact . 
 i would like to ask the commissioner , to operate in these two areas and involve us . 
 in view of the recent natural disasters , i would like to comment on the use of the funds . 
 we know that it is the responsibility of the respective countries , a part of the resources themselves to distribute . 
 it is not acceptable that - as it seems - the intention of the member states europe is no longer in operation . 
 the public and the press us today , not to enter into phenomenon , where we are funding a grossteil at the level of individual states . 
 i think we can say it loud and clear . 
 i also think that if europe aid , in order to repair the damage caused by natural disasters or accidents , we should inform our aid or ask the member states , to accept this . 
 mr president , to give priority to financial and monetary criteria reinforces means to strengthen inequalities of every kind . 
 french professional planners consider it highly likely that , for example , currently the regional differences within the various countries will be further deepened . 
 but the structural funds have contributed to this development . 
 our aim is a europe that is based on a provision of the social needs , and this requires upwards convergence of living conditions . 
 the implementation of this goal certainly means extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds . 
 we think in particular of a unified capital tax , which would allow funds to be used for a harmonization of social security systems and the reduction of working hours in europe . 
 but the commission , which has the task of guidelines , does so only reluctantly and remains vague . 
 the report provides the politics of its real significance today . 
 it is a step in the direction of employment and sustainable development . 
 and that is why we are going to agree with him . 
 mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on their excellent work . 
 faced with the challenge of globalization and the eastward enlargement in the next few years , i believe that europe needs for programming and revive its economy more than ever , appropriate and precise targets . 
 in this sense , the european union as a whole , and each member state in particular of all available resources and opportunities and also make optimum use of the existing structural funds . 
 , that the european commission is needed on the good intentions , but more transparency guidelines and specifically to the control of the use of these funds by the member states . 
 in italy , for example , in the last few years , there have been problems in the use of the structural funds , while the main reasons in a bloated bureaucracy , insufficient information and is , that the economic and social players at local level too little . 
 the commission , therefore , i would like to highlight two points : first , the consultation as a means of coordination and participation of all local and regional operators an optimal decisions be used specifically to avoid imbalances and inequalities ; secondly , there is a need for simpler and more transparent administrative processes , which all too often drag and , above all , are so complicated that they was criticised by the european smes will constitute an obstacle for access to the fund . 
 i think it is quite serious that the territorial abschliessend pacts and , above all , the methods of combating the trafficking of women and youth unemployment in the communication of the commission is little attention has been paid . 
 mr president , i think it is a particular pleasure as well as my colleague , mr evans , for the first time in this house on this very important issue to take the floor , because i represent a part of the united kingdom , with the west midlands , in the benefit of objective 2-fördermitteln . 
 but the report before the house today is a classic example of that , if we are not careful , ideas , the sound fantastic , for the people who benefit directly from them are may , however , be of little concern . 
 the report itself has a good intention , but it lacks as many of our activities in this field to a clear objective and a sound basis for its implementation in practice . 
 therefore , my group and i propose three important changes and additions , with which we in no way dilute the proposal , but with which we his relevance for those whom he should serve as guidance . 
 let me explain . 
 for us , it is firstly a ordnungsgemässe use of resources from the structural and cohesion funds . 
 the past experience has shown that we , as elected representatives of the european taxpayer financial probity and transparency in the disbursement of these funds and the related auditing should demand , and indeed must achieve what we want . with our amendments and additions to the granting of grants can serve as an indicator for the economically advantageous solution . 
 secondly , all too often fliessen vast sums of money in projects whose results estimate is simply not clear at the beginning of the period . 
 and the desired success , there is no effective way , the project to mid - term or indeed to end at the end of this period . 
 our additions , therefore , we call for practical and enforceable opportunities of coming out of a programme in which we do not only safeguard against further costs , often at the expense of the taxpayer , but we also prevented that , as happened so often in the past , money is being wasted . 
 and schliesslich , we call for a change in focus and methodology of the disbursement . 
 so should the private sector through the element of the financial reality , be more involved in the funding equation . 
 also on the nature of the projects should be the focus shifted away from the project , which will be difficult to monitor , to relocate investment projects , in which the use in the majority of cases openly on the hand . 
 they will meet the call for more transparency in the use of the money , and the temptation , the local tax base in areas where such projects will be carried out , unnecessary burden over a long period of time , successfully countered . and the parliament will show how seriously it takes the call for such reforms . 
 these changes , they should be approved by this house today , in my opinion , another major step towards the achievement of the historic goals for which the funds were set up , namely the sustained support to the impoverished areas in the european union , in which the living , not by handouts , but concrete aid must be raised to a decent level . 
 i urge the house to support these changes . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would also like to congratulate its report drawn up with fleiss and care so much . 
 without doubt , the structural and cohesion of the european union is the main instruments , the conditions for growth and for the dismantling of economic and social imbalances in the regions . 
 despite the previous measures these imbalances are still very strong , in terms of unemployment . 
 the objectives of these policies can be implemented as fully as possible , they must be coordinated and be implemented on the basis of careful , sensible guidelines . 
 let us not forget that these policies if they are effective , will also be visible for european citizens , an immediate improvement in their quality of life . 
 furthermore , we consider that the islands and remote regions of the european union deserve special attention , because of its geographical situation they are in their economic and social development at a great disadvantage , unless , the commission intends to build bridges or underwater tunnels in order to combine them with the european mainland . 
 abschliessend , let me say that the structural policies as a whole must be made more flexible , so that they can adapt to changing conditions and respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best , . 
 mr president mrs schroedter , the report contains many important indications , and i would like to congratulate you . 
 we should , however , be the orientation and the results of the community more heart . 
 this headline some problems : the mass unemployment will not only not be dismantled , but within the framework of structural policy even worse ausmasse . 
 the agriculture and irreparable damage irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy , with disastrous consequences for employment in rural areas and the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the south . 
 the regional disparities , within the member states in an alarming way . 
 according to the data of the sixth report , it is clear that the regional disparities in the last ten years has increased substantially . 
 the enormous problems the union of the island , where the deficiencies in the infrastructure , transport , communications and energy will lead to a continuous exodus of the population , almost no attention , or none at all . 
 this situation is caused by both the regional as well as the economic and social policy of the union in general . 
 broad swathes of the population of the union strongly condemn this policy as dangerous and anti - grass roots . 
 unfortunately , the new guidelines in the same direction , and there is nothing to indicate that its implementation will change that . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , please allow me , i would like to say a few words to highlight two points , in these reports and in the idea that we have of the union , a major strategic role . 
 the first is the massgebliche and central importance that we attach to the principle of the economic and social cohesion continues . 
 we express our concern about reports , which shows that the importance of this objective in the views of the commission is increasingly falling . 
 we are still of the opinion that the economic and social cohesion is a key objective of the european union . 
 secondly , i agree with what i have heard from a colleague on the issue of the islands , and i would also like to draw your attention to the areas in äusserster regions . 
 in future , we would have more courage in dealing with the issue of the forward areas in äusserster regions , as in the case of my country for the archipelagos of madeira and the azores . 
 i would like to take this opportunity to ask whether we can explain to the commission on the reasons why the report of the commission on the areas in äusserster delayed , the parliament has been expected . 
 mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur , also for being willing to include suggestions we made in the report . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , with guidelines are intended to help towards achieving the goals of the member states within the framework of the programming will be offered . 
 the requirements of the commission but contrary to their claim to provide guidance , but a catalogue of possible measures within the framework of the policies . 
 to give direction and priorities , but their true purpose . 
 i agree with the rapporteur , the commission document that unfortunately too little in the way of recommendations to the member states of administrative and endorse calls for negotiations to concentrate on the promotion of a favorable environment for labor - intensive small and medium - sized enterprises , on a clear objective for alternative sources of financing einschliesslich rules for venture capital and private financing , and on occupational companies einschliesslich new information technologies and investment in innovative fields . 
 in my group , my special support an amendment to paragraph 10 , an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects . 
 i would be delighted , mrs schroedter , if this amendment is also under the aspect of subsidiarity in their positive considerations would involve . 
 mr president , represented in the committee for employment and social affairs commissioner , we are unanimous in the view that the support of the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds for a better job opportunities for the unemployed and for equality between men and women is of strategic importance and priority . 
 unfortunately , the excellent schroedter report this idea has not taken into account , even though there is many evidence , we will see later in the report berend , as these funds really excellent help the less developed regions , the attempt to bridge the gap between them and the most developed regions of europe . 
 they are growing , but in terms of gdp . 
 their competitiveness is increasing , but the growing wealth reached not all , because the number of jobs increased and the difference in employment opportunities in the different regions . 
 read the opinion of the committee , commissioner for employment and social affairs , and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is the big problem for the citizens of europe . 
 and you in the review , the allocation of reserves , the strategic requirements of the employment , because it is at the end of the day , what the structural and cohesion funds require . 
 mr president , the guidelines must be made so that the programme of the important right direction five years from 2002 to 2006 and increase their efficiency , so as to ensure sustainable development and the promotion of employment , especially for women and young people , and the balance is maintained between the economic and social and environmental policy . 
 it is particularly important to address those serious problems in the urban areas , employment in rural areas , the promotion of agricultural regions and , of course , as provided for in article 158 of the treaty - granting equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union , including , of course , for the greek , the half of the islands of the union . 
 the policy must be further strengthened , because a europe with a significant gap in living standards between the regions is neither credible nor can it was . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have said their stellenweisen criticisms and suggestions in connection with the report by elisabeth schroedter , listened attentively and with wide interest . 
 rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , we all know the reasons , the dates , the delays and i will come to talk about , but today we are discussing the report , for me and for the commission at the right time , since it is the guidelines for 2000 - 2006 and we are starting the new regional programming . 
 elisabeth schroedter , you have rightly pointed out that it is essentially the responsibility of member states and regions define their own priorities . however , on the basis of the co - financing of the programme with the european union , it is right and necessary that community priorities will also be taken into consideration , as it will be debated and approved , in order to promote this community dimension of the economic and social cohesion , to which many of them forcefully . 
 therefore , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to say a few words about the role and structure of the guidelines before the comments or the criticism that you , madam schroedter , or you , ladies and gentlemen , have put forward to speak . 
 in terms of the role and structure of the guidelines , the chairman of the committee hatzidakis , the rapporteur and mccarthy have reminded that the purpose of these guidelines , the national and regional authorities in the preparation of their programming strategy for each 1 , 2 and 3 of the structural funds and their links with the objectives to support the cohesion fund . 
 it is about the commission 's priorities , from the experience in the implementation of the programme , the current policies in the context of the present strukturmassnahmen . 
 these priorities are - as requested - here several times to better use , an optimal and efficient use of course help , if necessary , the reserve , mr bradbourn , in particular , has the objective to ensure optimal and efficient use of public funds in europe . 
 and when i speak of optimum use , i think both the national and regional level ; and , mr president , at a national level , i mean , the link with the cohesion fund . 
 the purpose of the guidelines . 
 with regard to the content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen , start that the guidelines of three strategic principles , the rapporteur said that with all clarity and wide emphasis pointed out at the same time . 
 the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of the regional economy , in all sectors , particularly in the private sector , as mr berend said , as many as possible to create a full and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of the economy of the regions , all regions , in particular , mr evans , wales , but not only of wales . 
 i would like to add here because some members have just pointed out , since this was their opinion appears to have forgotten , the regional economies of the disadvantaged regions by their location , the peripheral regions , the island and , of course , the regions in äusserster . 
 in this context , i would like to comment on the remarks made by mr ribeiro e castro and say to him that the commission , as i wrote to the presidents of each in äusserster outermost regions has asked - for a few weeks to extend the deadline for the presentation of the report . 
 the communications of individual governments to the regions in äusserster we have received quite late , but this is not an excuse , but an explanation . 
 it is now a question , to take into account these documents and evaluate very carefully . 
 on november 23 , i participated in a meeting of representatives of the regions in äusserster regions , and we were in the commission agreed that we need several more weeks to submit a report to the very serious and important issues and will meet the expectations of this in äusserster outermost regions ; i would like to thank you for your understanding . 
 so that is the first priority , the competitiveness at regional level . 
 the second priority , which several of you has been mentioned , particularly by mr puerta - i am not by an order of priorities , is on the improvement of social cohesion and employment should be promoted , and more particularly , the human resources in the future . 
 ladies and gentlemen , if we find that the differences between the member states in the european union have become less - was in fact for the cohesion fund and its efficiency , but at the same time unemployment - according to the rapporteur and the differences between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest and most disadvantaged regions grösser , then this is a situation that is intolerable and unjustifiable . 
 because of my ideas on the construction of europe and of regional development policy in particular , i think this is a situation i cannot accept . i intend , within the framework of my opportunities and , with your support , all funds , for which i am responsible , for improved social , human and territorial cohesion to use to prevent that , as i mentioned before this house , there is a two - speed europe , a europe of send district and a europe of the poor suburbs . 
 the third objective is to an urban and rural development in the context of a balanced policy . 
 the guidelines on the other two horizontal principles : the development of the rural areas , and the question of a sustainable european rapporteur , the dear to me for a long time , especially since my time as minister of my country , i heard in the area of rural development - and the second principle is the equal opportunities between women and men , as well as the european employment strategy , in particular , and the economic and monetary union . 
 the rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , to their geäusserten concerns in the debate , i would like to say that in the guidelines on the importance and the establishment of integrated development or redevelopment , the priorities grösstmögliche synergies of the measures and decentralised partnership . 
 they are worried because this partnership does not seem to be have been made . 
 however , it is clearly on page 5 of these guidelines , and i would like to stress that this partnership , because they have asked me to care for me , and i have a long enough region , in order to be able to judge this - a very effective instrument to mobilise the intellectual resources at local level - both those in the public sector - the city and local councils , the educational and social areas , clubs and associations , as well as those of the private sector , and the regional pacts are to respond to a remark by mrs angelilli , one of the forms of the decentralized partnership . 
 the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities in an orderly way , so that they are within the framework of the various objectives in different mass depending on the specific situation of each of the member states and regions can be taken into account . 
 now , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to some of their comments ; the first for the procedure . 
 it is true that their house has been late in dealing with the matter . 
 i would like to remind you that , following the guidelines of the commission in the form of a draft in february 1999 after a new procedure in which the distribution of opinions on the text has been simplified , were adopted , it by my predecessor , monica wulf - mathies , were immediately forwarded to parliament . 
 but because of the time the european elections was their house until after the final adoption of the text in july 1999 with the start to examine the guidelines . 
 now , i can assure you , ladies and gentlemen , that we in the negotiations on the programmes are only beginning , the chairman of the committee , mr hatzidakis has already consulted , and that therefore their comments in most member states can be taken into account . 
 i can tell you that the commission expressed the opinion of their house in this report , at the time of the adoption of the guidelines prescribed for the so - called mid - term review will take into account . 
 now to the form . 
 the rapporteur , you pointed out that this comes to a number of european objectives , often very precise ones . 
 i can now not mention them all : the introduction of cross - sectoral measures , more efficient use of public money to support the various partners in the joint development of regional or national programmes and the commission takes note of this , but some of these guidelines or issues do not belong here , but for example in the vademecum or methodological document . 
 abschliessend , rapporteur , i would like to concentrate on some ideas of their report . 
 i am thinking , for example , in the statement that the guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations . 
 however , this statement must be viewed from the perspective of the negotiations last spring . 
 the commission has kept to the wording of article 10 of the regulation , the guidelines as " general indicative guidelines on the basis of relevant policies and agreed . " 
 das was quoted directly after the wording of the regulation , in quotation marks . 
 and guidelines are not a substitute for the programming or ex - ante assessments , the serve , to determine the priorities and the effectiveness of the programme . 
 also , the rapporteur on the section of the guidelines for the development of the rural and urban areas , " that will be referred to the urban development on the brink . 
 it seems to me that the opposite is true . 
 i can confirm to you that the commission attaches great importance to this urban dimension in the area of cohesion policy and in the future will attach . 
 i have also recently the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere . 
 the rural development , which has been repeatedly addressed here , especially mrs redondo jiménez , the guidelines are referred to by the rapporteur double objective : a strong agriculture , with improved competitiveness in the rural areas , but also environmental protection and management of rural heritage . 
 this , however , must be borne in mind that these guidelines , we are talking about , related only to the structural funds , whose objectives 1 and 2 , in particular , diversification of rural areas a priority . 
 was this balance in the rural areas , so we must here the new policy of the development of the rural areas , will be on the eaggf ' guarantee ' , not forget . it has the objective of the reform of the european agriculture and multi - functionality of agriculture to promote . 
 today i would like to say that i hope that this issue will be included in the programming of the rural objective - 2 areas , as with the eaggf " orientation " for objective - regions . 
 in any case , it has become clear to me that it will carefully follow up committee on agriculture and rural development in this aspect . 
 before i conclude , i would like to say that tomorrow mr savary a separate debate on the impact of the storms of the last few weeks , particularly in france , austria and germany and that there is also opportunity tomorrow , with my colleague , de palacio to speak on the conclusions to be drawn from the oil slick in france . 
 i will restrict myself now , sir , to tell you my opinion , the big parts with its own assessment of what we can achieve with objective 2 for the fight against the oil slick , covers . 
 i would like to point out that the commission tomorrow the objective - zoning plans for france , sweden , austria and luxembourg will confirm . 
 we will then have a working tool available , particularly in a grossteil of the regions affected by the storms . 
 for this reason , i will travel in two french departments under way the day after the storms were particularly strong . 
 abschliessend , mr president , thank you very much for your understanding , i would like to thank you for their report , mrs ; you and your committee have done a good job . 
 apart from certain differences of opinion with regard to the role of the guidelines , we have talked about this and i have tried to explain to you my position , i am very pleased , as their house to the preparation of these guidelines , the member states to prepare their own programmes . 
 this encourages us to maintain our approach , that on a number of best practice from the current 1994 - 1999 . 
 i think the beginning of programming for the period 2000 to 2006 augurs well for the cooperation between our two institutions , for a confirmation of our common work , mr hatzidakis , the code of conduct which binds our two institutions and its compliance with my heart , will be strengthened . 
 the debate is closed . 
 the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . 
 socio - economic situation and development of the regions 
 the next item on the agenda is the debate on the report ( a5 - 0107 / 1999 ) by mr berend , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the socio - economic situation and development of the regions of the european union ( sec ( 99 ) 0066 c5 - 0120 / / 2123 ( cos ) 99 - 1999 ) . 
 mr president , mr barnier , ladies and gentlemen , this sixth periodic report on the socio - economic situation and development of the regions of the european union marks a new stage in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made since the appearance of the fifth periodic report . 
 however , i am of the opinion that the reality of the situation is not entirely fair , if we talk about a real convergence of the average regional levels in europe . unfortunately , this picture but in the press or in some speeches . 
 the commission 's report puts this assessment , particularly when it the socio - economic situation in certain regions , describes the particularly close to my heart , . i mean the french overseas departments and , more generally , the regions in äusserster regions . 
 i am delighted that the committee has adopted one of my amendments for regional policy , calling on the commission , a separate chapter in its next report on cohesion in äusserster regions , especially to include an analysis of the impact of the measures , which will soon be taken in accordance with the new article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam . 
 the sixth periodic report contains schliesslich with regard to the objective of a balanced and sustainable development in europe some interesting arguments , particularly when it on the importance of relations between the centre of europe and its periphery . 
 even if the commission is still reluctant to explicitly pointing out the periodic report shows the urgent need for a polycentric development of the area through the union and structural policies within the framework of the esa - approach . 
 mr president , the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report of mr berend and congratulates its author , both for the quality of its conclusions and to its flexibility , the amendments of the different groups could be included in the committee . 
 it must be remembered that the global competitiveness of the european union is currently 81 % of the level of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the improved our competitive economic entities , namely the regions , and this is at a time when the technological development , the globalization of the economy and our problems , enlargement and the single currency , from the regions , but also the companies and individuals higher general demand . 
 the european commission provides very valuable sixth report conclusions . 
 i would like to summarise two of those , the rapporteur has already taken a positive and a negative . 
 the first relates to the fact that meaningful progress in the territorial and social cohesion in the entire territory of the union and the community an important , if not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities . 
 the negative is that these big efforts in the alignment of the gdp and productivity of the european regions showed a higher impact than in their employment . 
 it is therefore necessary to tie , structural funding to the creation of more jobs . 
 the commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period . 
 thus , mr president , i ask my fellow members to approve this report and , like others before me , i would ask the commission , the conclusions from the sixth periodic report on the planning for the period 2000 to 2006 to take into account . 
 mr president , commissioner , first of all , i would like the rapporteur for the good work done and thank the factual account of the proposed amendments during the discussion in the committee . 
 the sixth periodic report is a good basis for assessing the implementation of the regional policy objectives and shows that the growth in the european union despite all efforts only ungleichmässig . 
 the central regions , there are still a very rapid growth , which is in the strong a pace , which centres on the pan - european average , while many southern and northern regions considerably more slowly . 
 what we need now is a profound analysis to the question of why the regional policy has not the desired success in all areas . 
 it is up to the bureaucracy or are the differences between regions , large distances , too cold or heisses climate , sparse population and austere conditions have not been sufficiently taken into account ? 
 how can the union , to meet the challenges of the global development so that the less developed regions compete ? 
 it is also important to the impact of enlargement on the structural funds and the development of the areas to investigate in äusserster regions . 
 the member states also must not shirk their responsibilities . 
 some countries have violated the principle of co - financing and cut the national budget for the regions , while the regional aid the union has been increased . 
 that was at the expense of regional policy . 
 in the future must also be given to the establishment of indicators , which measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place . 
 for example , uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently taken into account . 
 also in this context , the crucial role of small and medium - sized enterprises as a motor for employment and regional development . 
 it is very important to introduce the latest technology and know - how for businesses in underdeveloped regions . 
 our group is in favour of the adoption of the report . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now in the european union 's regional policy failed , the differences in the per capita output significantly to express . 
 the situation is serious , in the european union today , because there is a clear link between unemployment and poverty , as the äusserst worrying fact shows that the unemployment in the regions most affected by this problem reached an average of 23.7 % , and the regions with poor areas , while in the 25 regions coincide with lower unemployment , the affluent areas , unemployment is only 4 % . 
 in the face of this situation , the report , adopted by the parliament , made clear that measures are needed , clearly aimed at combating the relative poverty and unemployment are . measures such as the proper use of the structural funds for these purposes , the often unsachgemäss used , with key state policies , the modernization of the telecommunications and communications , in particular by the least developed regions until the expected 2007 in the trans - european networks , and development of agricultural and fishery resources and fishing capacities of these countries , which are often discriminated against in the policies of indifferent european union , the promotion of active employment policies , mainly for women and young people . 
 it is only with the consistent implementation of such measures , it will be possible to overcome , a social and regional balance , not weaken the historic result of unavoidable but , of exclusion and economic policies with negative effects . 
 mr president , commissioner , the report of the colleagues berend follows exactly the strategy by the european commission by the issue of increasing competitiveness is absolutely in the fore . 
 the overarching objective of the structural funds , such as job creation , boosting employment , strengthen the guarantees of equal opportunities , increasing the durability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing . 
 this view seems to me to be unjustified , and i would also ask that these points in the seventh periodic report very much more . 
 that does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness , more so when i myself am entrepreneurs in an objective 1 - area , and in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany , and very aware of the concerns and needs of small and medium - sized enterprises . 
 1 - regions are temporary measures in the parallel imperative , namely arbeitsbeschaffungsmassnahmen , special programmes for the promotion of employment and initiatives to promote the start of independent work . 
 they will be supported by appropriate action from the structural funds of the european union . 
 to support the competitiveness of companies alone can never compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because the foundations for a self - sustaining recovery in these objective 1 - regions . 
 and the experience that underpins economic development alone does not help to reduce unemployment , but the fact that at least 3 % increase in the gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs . 
 the ausschliessliche concentration on demand , supply - side economic policy can not work . 
 and if you have , we grösstenteils investment and less rationalisation . 
 it must be the imperative with a demand - driven economic policy if we are to have any chance to improve the social situation in these areas . 
 these situations in the regions are very , very different . 
 that is , what is needed is a lot of accompanying measures , in order to be able to make anything there . 
 for example , these would be measures to vocational training , training , the reintegration of people who have already been excluded from the production process , to flexibilisation of working hours and personal and social aspects to be able to better reconcile and perhaps also decided to promote the employment of women again . 
 mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur for his detailed report . 
 with the structural funds is essentially the economic and social cohesion between the regions of the european union . 
 with the help of the european union is endeavouring to an increase of gdp per capita , and in order to increase employment . 
 from the sixth careful periodic report on the regions , one can conclude that these incentives right often do not have the desired effect . 
 the increase of per capita gdp in the goal - 1 efforts do not always lead to this growth , not just a satisfactory outcome in a time , especially in recent years , marked by economic recovery . 
 as the rapporteur , furthermore , an impact on unemployment strukturmassnahmen is barely felt . 
 that is why i think it is appropriate for the evaluation of the effectiveness of eu aid to exercise restraint . 
 also , the observation that the differences between the regions in the states sometimes even worse , raises serious questions . 
 it therefore seems appropriate and necessary to our attention when it comes to employment , both at the national and regional authorities . 
 they are well aware of the best regions in their area of responsibility . 
 by massgeschneiderte develop programmes for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this can , a grösserer effect . 
 and that is what it is all about . 
 i therefore begrüsse it , if the commission the practical details and the implementation of measures to the member states and regions . 
 in this context , it is certainly better anyway , in the funding for the regions to place greater emphasis on the member states . 
 with the transfer of the criteria of the regions to the member states , we can avoid a lot of future problems . 
 finally , i would like to highlight the situation of the central and eastern european countries . 
 as stated in the report , they have often , especially in terms of gdp per capita , a significant gap between europe and the countries of the european union . 
 in view of the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , i believe that it is urgent to review the current structural policy . 
 like many others , i also call on the commission to present proposals for reform quickly . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , after closer study of this report to the conclusion that the stated objective of the structural policy could only be partially met . 
 for example , the disparity between the regions has increased rather than decreased , the member states themselves have a degree of convergence here . 
 equally , the unemployment rate in the most affected regions barely be reduced , they even rose in some cases . 
 i wonder why it is that the funds were not used more efficiently . 
 even the accumulation of funds from the cohesion and structural funds has not brought the desired success in all regions and countries . 
 after the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce the unemployment , the critical question , whether the policy is the right one , or whether it is not zweckmässiger , the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improving the infrastructure and raising the level of training to strengthen ? 
 serious structural reforms and a competition - friendly fiscal policy are the building blocks of a successful economy . 
 if we do not want to let the accusation , pursuing a costly structural policy , in the question of employment is not sustainable , the previous measures must be questioned . 
 successful is the policy of the union if it manages to create sufficient jobs and the unemployment rate is falling significantly . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks to the rapporteur for the treatment of this very important issue . 
 schliesslich is crucial for the development of the social and economic situation , as the citizens of europe to assess the success of our work . 
 the problems for the credibility of the eu , with which the people are struggling every day , is of crucial importance . 
 we have to admit that the development of poorer countries in the eu already - even in my view very grosszügig - has supported . 
 when i consider how it looked in portugal and greece , as these countries 25 years ago , i , for the first time , then i would like to salute the eu , or , as the french say " coup de chapeau . " 
 the eu really deserves . in the countries themselves , but there are still big differences between rich and poor regions . 
 what are the consequences ? 
 people react by voting with the füssen and leave their homes . 
 so we have on several occasions for the same people in the same country build schools , hospitals and the entire infrastructure . 
 furthermore , this is a very expensive matter and is also leading to major social problems . 
 most people , however , would like to live , where they were born , if you were given the chance to have , so if you work . 
 we must give them this opportunity . 
 it is a moral duty , and the eu is imposed on us all . 
 i see a solution in a tangible promotion of entrepreneurship . 
 however , i mean not only to have a company , but the will to run a business . 
 i mean the attitude , which led the people to move in his life , whether as workers , entrepreneurs , or officials . 
 what is a fair society ? 
 it is a society in which a man from a modest background can get , so there is little easier for his children . 
 this is also the possibility of a positive development of the regions , because the people are committed and , if the conditions are created for work . 
 abschliessend in this relationship , i would like to point out that we should learn from the united states of america , where fleiss is still in fashion and success is a proof of ability and not the object of envy , as it often is in europe . 
 mr president , mr barnier , ladies and gentlemen , because i have very little time available , i am straight to the point . 
 first , a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed within the union . 
 one example is the in äusserster outermost regions , where unemployment is still dramatic ausmasse . 
 in reunion , for example , the rate is 37 % . 
 this situation is not economically , but structural arises because of distance , our island , in short , our identity . 
 to remedy the situation , is in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam , the principle of a specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged . 
 it is this principle into practice . 
 the paper of the commission was first announced in december 1999 to january and then postponed to february , and the first thinking i am not optimistic . 
 i therefore appeal to the council and the commission . 
 the fiscal policy , the state aid , the structural funds , the protection of domestic production there is an urgent need for concrete , bolder and more ambitious measures . 
 convergence and cohesion otherwise empty words for us , and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the high end means a failure . 
 thank you very much , commissioner . 
 the debate is closed . 
 the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . 
 ( the sitting is closed at 8.25 p.m. ) 
 approval of the minutes of the previous meeting 
 the minutes of the last meeting have been distributed . 
 are there any comments ? 
 this , mr president , i am an geäusserten yesterday afternoon by the president of the house request , on behalf of my group to take the matter referred to in the protocol . 
 i am referring to paragraph 11 of the business . 
 first of all , i believe that the proposal presented by the chairman of the socialist group in the european parliament to reopen the debate with the president of the commission on the strategic programme for the next five years because of that other speakers like briefly to ago have had enough weight so that he should have been met . 
 i would like to make it clear , even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group . 
 the second point i would like to make - and i like yesterday before the vote - is that this parliament , as several members said yesterday , only then can really achieve something , if it cooperates closely with the european commission and synergy . 
 we should also have the humility to see that we are not just a week before the real debate in this house can establish the mechanisms necessary to carry out a strategic debate , not only limited to a presentation and explanations on the part of the president of the commission , but also will be presented to a five - year programme . only in this way can we send our wish to the commission in time and discuss this . 
 i would like to , that we learn a fundamental lesson . 
 if , in the future major debates on certain issues between the house and the european commission , then we should at least one full month in advance , who has what . 
 first , it must be clear between the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission . 
 it should not happen , that this or that institution unnecessary burden on the relations between the institutions in the last minute . 
 when i look at some of the press reports last friday , i have the impression that the commission and its president in their public opinions have exercised commendable self - restraint in the way . 
 i am deeply grateful to you . 
 i hope that we will learn the lessons and spare us this unnecessary exercise in the future , i believe that in terms of our mutual expectations was based on a misunderstanding and was neither malicious intent or the other institution . 
 we should not continue to play . 
 thank you very much , mr cox . 
 i understand what you are saying . 
 we have taken note . 
 mr president , i am referring to paragraph 11 of the protocol on the business . we agreed yesterday , the bourlanges report today on the agenda . 
 however , the report was yesterday evening by the committee vote was neither advised nor . 
 it must therefore be removed from the agenda . 
 mr wynn , this is logical . 
 the report is , therefore , removed from the agenda . 
 mr president , i would like to refer to what lynne said yesterday about health and safety in this building . i assume that the drains in the fifth floor of the tower , said , according to which it very strong smell . 
 something has to be done about this , because of the smell , clearly indicates that there is something here that is not true . 
 i will not go on this matter , but we have to deal with a serious problem here . 
 mrs ahern , we have taken note . 
 i would like to ask you , this specific case , which refers to the fans in a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestors , because the are , in fact , responsible for . 
 we will also pass on to our services , however . 
 thank you very much . 
 ( the parliament approved the protocol ) .

 a5 - 0087 mr jonckheer / 1999 on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the seventh of the commission report ( com ) 148 ( 1999 - c5 - 0107 / 1999 - 2110 ( cos ) on state aid in the european union in the manufacturing sector and in some other sectors ( 1995 - 1997 ) ; report 
 a5 - 0073 mr langen / 1999 on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the report of the commission ( com ( 1999 ) 94 - c5 - 0104 / 1999 - 2107 ( cos ) on the application of its decision no 2496 / 96 / ecsc on 18 december 1996 establishing community rules on state aid to the iron and steel ( steel aid code ) in 1998 . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , 
 we now lead a major debate on competition policy of the european union . we are debating a very controversial in the european antitrust law , namely the report to modernise von wogau , and that is far more controversial than it perhaps the vote in committee has made it clear . 
 i want to make it quite clear that i personally in this specific case , the commission 's proposal for wrong that it remains to be seen whether the concept of modernization for the content of the articles 81 and 82 weissbuches really is justified or whether in this case would not be more appropriate concept retrograde step . 
 however , we are also on the aid report today and the general competition for 1998 , and my part in this joint debate relates to the latter . 
 but both the report and the aid report - have common ground in this weissbuch , too , of course . 
 it is about the right of about the need for modernization , the future viability of the european competition . 
 we both read commission documents , so 1998 was a year in which launched the 1997 were pursued and parts have yet to be finalised , we know this from our ongoing parliamentary work . 
 let me as the competent authority to make two basic points : the commission with its consistent attitude , has always worked for competition , not always to the delight of the affected states or enterprises . 
 they should continue along this path . 
 however , commissioner , will all less complicated in future - i would just remind you of the challenge by the enlargement of the union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation . 
 it is not just on the modernisation of community law , it is more than ever on the transparency of the decisions on a case - by - case basis , to the possibility of decisions to be able to understand , because the european competition policy is on the acceptance of the population and the affected political bodies and the companies concerned . 
 only , without transparency , there can be no acceptance , and then also no modernization without transparency . 
 the report 1998 is not a bad basis for this , but there is nothing that was not even better . 
 we will put forward a number of suggestions , commissioner , with our entschliessung to you , but i will go into now on one aspect : transparency and accountability belong together . 
 i will not interfere with the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament . 
 the commission is the executive , and the parliament should also do not want to be for the sake its own independence , but the parliament is a supervisory body , and where can one explain its reasons for the decision more than a democratically elected parliament and in a permanent parliamentary discourse ? 
 here too , we should continue along the path , strengthening and intensifying it . 
 one thing but i want to say very clearly : the parliament is a legislative body ; that we have only consultation rights but the law , this is a scandal ! 
 this is the request to the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure . 
 i expect the commission , that all the possibilities of parliamentary cooperation and to be exploited in the final result , in doubt for the involvement of the parliament , and has also been in the present treaty arrangements . 
 i also expect that the commission will support us in the call for co - offensive in the legislative process . 
 this will be a test case for the sound cooperation between the two institutions . 
 in all , however , commitment to principle , competition is not a goal in itself . 
 competition is an instrument and does not always lead to the best solutions . 
 it is now time for the economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects , and whoever disputes that is an ideologue , nothing else . 
 competition should bring about balance in supply and demand , should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts . 
 but not necessarily optimum efficiency is by itself . 
 conditions are essential to prevent abuse , for example , by the law . 
 but in essence , this only prevent misuse , it alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals . 
 competition yes , restrictions on the aid , where needed and where possible . 
 but because the bulk of the aid in the competition 1998 , i shall , without prejudice to the report of the colleagues junker , but still a sentence to say : aid to small and medium - sized enterprises in research and development , the training in the regional , in the environment , it is certainly possible and must be feasible . 
 aid should be allowed for such purposes , as long as they do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition . 
 here it is even more important than in monopolies for mergers , and that decisions are understandable . 
 aid includes not only to denounce ; they must be more nuanced view , they must also be evaluated for their contribution to the achievement of the objectives . 
 the last remark was less to the commission , but to the members of the group . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report , i propose to you today is an opinion on the commission 's annual report on the state aid in the european union , pursuant to article 87 , 88 and 89 of the treaties in the competence of the community . 
 the commission 's report is essentially a descriptive and describes the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and in some other sectors , according to various typologies , such as the way of financing and the objectives . 
 as regards the quantitative aspect of the report , i would like to refer to the grounds and simply that the average annual total for the period under review in the grössenordnung of 95 billion euros , a reduction of around 13 % compared to the 1993 - period 1995 , which essentially is due to a reduction in aid in the federal republic of germany . 
 in plain language , this means that the average state during the reporting period in big and is generally stable and 1.2 % of the community more or less to the gdp , coincidentally the community budget for one year . 
 the differences between the states , which may be measured in different ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of the value - added and a running , however , are considerably . 
 my opinion is also interesting , to add the state aid and the community , to a certain extent , can be assimilated state aid . 
 then it shows very clearly that the four countries , which receive cohesion funds , among other things , in the first place . 
 let me now turn to the proposals made in the report . 
 first of all , i note that the commission is of the opinion that the data are too aggregiert outlined in the commission 's annual report , to allow for a thorough evaluation of state aid policy . this is a legitimate and a sensitive point in terms of national interests , but also of importance in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , in accordance with the treaty . 
 the commission can only collect and analyse the data provided by the member states . 
 it is also the task of states and regions , to ensure the quality of the data , and from the point of view of our committee for additional efforts are needed . 
 in the same spirit , our parliamentary committee maintains the old idea of a public register of state aid , in particular , should be available on the internet . 
 the availability of better and more detailed data to the objectives and the results recorded , in particular , it would allow the european commission , regelmässig carry out studies on the economic evaluation of national and regional state design aid matters or to carry out . 
 in the mass , as some of these studies already exist , they could set their own comments from the point of view of the objectives of the treaties , which in addition to ensure the competitiveness of the european economy , but also the sustainable development and economic and social cohesion , publish more . 
 we have in our debate in the committee and also in the report , i present to you the honour , the quality of the information provided to the fore and abstained from any simplification , which consisted of a priori to claim that the state aid are absolutely seen either too high or not high enough . 
 the majority of the members of the committee were seek , between the need for countries and businesses comply with the rules , and the recognition of the importance of such aid as a contribution to the objectives of the treaty , above all , as i said , in the areas of sustainable development , research and development , and economic and social cohesion on the other side , a balance . 
 on this basis , were several amendments to the original draft in committee rapporteur decided . the emphasis was on the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be as unrechtmässig actually recover , and to draw up a list of the results . 
 seven amendments will be presented this plenary session once again . 
 they reflect mostly our different political views on zweckmässigkeit and effectiveness of state aid in view of the problems of private investment , the market failures or gap left . 
 i would like to stress that i am as rapporteur , especially an amendment to the energy policy as particularly important . 
 let me abschliessend a concern of the committee on the one hand and , on the other hand , refer to a call by our committee , commissioner . 
 the concern is the pre - accession process of the central and eastern european countries from the point of view of competition and state aid . 
 there is no doubt we have to do with a complex issue and we would hope that the commission informed about the current state , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies of the candidate countries to comply with competition rules , and was the state aid is concerned , the need , that probably specific rules on state aid to support the restructuring of the respective sectors need to be created . 
 the call schliesslich concerns the future here in the powers of the european parliament to debate the areas of competition and state aid , with a view of the intergovernmental conference . 
 in our report , as you know , commissioner , defended the idea that fundamental to the adoption of legislation on state aid the codecision procedure should apply . 
 mr president , commissioner , my part in today 's debate concerns the rules for steel subsidies . these are the public aid in europe , according to this code have been awarded and the commission has examined . 
 there are a total of 27 cases in 1998 . the commission submitted its own report on these . 
 the ecsc will expire shortly . 
 that is why the question the us today , in particular , must be managed in future . 
 the decisions of the european commission , in the report , the european parliament begrüsst , einschliesslich reclaim the decision to ask for the money in a specific case and that applying the article 88 of the ecsc treaty . 
 the competitiveness of the european steel industry also content of the commission 's recent communication , on which we have not yet debated in parliament . 
 as in other sectors also applies to the iron and steel industry the general aid according to article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty . 
 according to this article , state aid fundamentally incompatible with the common market . 
 the exceptions are allowed only in very specific cases . 
 in accordance with article 88 , the commission is obliged to control of state aid . 
 in 1998 , the fatherland case guarantee the flow of capital to the preussag in germany to the tune of 540 million euros . 
 furthermore , the member states of the commission must inform their beihilfevorhaben previously . 
 for the steel industry have been drawn up the rules on 18 december 1996 . 
 after that , it can aid the steel industry will be awarded only in certain cases , precisely defined . it is research and development , these , social aid to promoting the schliessung steelworks and aid for final help non - competitive enterprises . 
 in addition , there is a special provision of up to 50 million euro for greece . 
 there were obviously in the practical implementation of the steel aid code in the past few years , however , problems in the report were not fully discussed . 
 it is important from the point of view of parliament , that are already talking about a successor arrangement after the expiry of this steel aid code . 
 one of the there must be no watering - down of the existing basic lines . 
 no one wants an unbridled race in europe . 
 the internal market , this would seriously affect even after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years . 
 therefore , the parliament considers it essential that the steel aid code be amended in terms of unequal treatment by the industry and the commission presented to the council a successor . 
 it is well known that the council has so far refused to make such a successor to beschliessen . 
 this is also due to the fact that one believes if the steel aid code expires , we can again without the inconvenience of control by the european commission , what we want . 
 therefore , we ask that after the expiry of the treaty expires by a council regulation must be regulated according to article 94 , because this is the only way to make the necessary legal and clarity . 
 the strict ban on all aid , which are not covered by the code , can only be enforced so . 
 a council regulation , which is directly applicable law , must also be observed by the regional governments . 
 damage to the competition and disturbance of the markets must also be avoided in the future . 
 the practice is also to criticise the commission to approve multiple aid packages for steel , which in their view , do not fall under the categories of the code , even if the european court of justice has approved this unequal treatment in individual decisions . 
 in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , the commission called on exceptional cases approved , its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and explain in detail and so on this basis to allow a proper assessment of the give . 
 after the economic and monetary affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , i would ask that we in the house this opportunity , we have ourselves , fully meet . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the single market is not yet complete . 
 subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding the markets and development . 
 national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but it happens again . 
 subsidies distort the appropriations , both in the countries themselves as well as between them . 
 state aid must gradually and more and more markets be opened up to competition , both in the private and state - owned monopolies . 
 state monopolies are only reluctantly . 
 however , a stronger competition and newly established companies could use big for the welfare , also in the spheres of education , health care and social services . 
 state monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures . 
 europe must be modernized and adapted to entrepreneurship and more competitive conditions for consumers and businesses . 
 an effective competition leads to lower prices and a higher standard of living . 
 the consumer policy focused too little on the price levels , but competition policy and consumer policy belong together . 
 the market is the basis of our work . 
 the legislation must apply to all gleichermassen , for big and small countries . 
 the removal of restrictions the national regulations should be systematically checked , and the legislation of the eu also need analysis . 
 the new model now being tested by the commission should not lead to a mere nationalisierungsprozess , competition policy would undermine the already achieved . 
 its effective implementation needs a strong roots in the national authorities of the member states . 
 after half a year , an analysis of the results , but also the impact of the new situation on the role of the commission be studied in greater depth . 
 the question of how to proceed now is with the proposal for a broad conference with representatives of various interest groups as a platform for an unbiased debate even resolved . 
 this offers the opportunity to establish new principles or return to the sweeping changes under discussion to seek new common solutions and in the discussions in the committees to analyse amendments . 
 the application of the law in competition must be correct . 
 competition policy , implemented can lead to disqualifications and impairments of important and covered by business secrecy protection principle of the right of ownership . 
 we have a very interesting debate in front of us . 
 at a conference on the these issues will be discussed , misunderstandings can be improved and if necessary certain points . 
 together with the parliament and the commission , can contribute to an effective competition policy and create new opportunities and new resources , which will benefit the people . 
 just in my constituency , stockholm , there are many good examples for a bigger supply and improved quality , have been made possible by the fact that previously monopolistic sectors have been replaced by competitive structures . 
 we support the continuation of the open debate , as it has manifested in the discussion of the von wogau and rapkay reports . 
 at the same time , we have the hope that also the importance of the legal aspects to them in a state governed by the rule of law . 
 mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased to be here today , as a new member , albeit with a time lag , to be able to make my first speech here . 
 first of all , i would like to thank the rapporteurs von wogau , long , rapkay , jonckheer , as well as the commission for the very good cooperation . 
 competition is certainly the basis of the social market economy and european competition policy is a success story , especially the energy and telecommunications sectors , significantly has led to lower prices and better service . 
 all this is for the benefit of the consumer . 
 but we have now got to a point where we need to develop the competition policy . 
 the commission has submitted a new weissbuch with two key points : dropping the return of law enforcement . 
 the departure of dropping the means , in any case , less bureaucracy and red tape . 
 at the same time , this change , of course , leads to more responsibility for the individual in the economy . 
 it is no longer so simple , only to submit and approve , but everyone must now take responsibility themselves , and this is also the reason , perhaps , that one or other draussen feels unease . 
 however , i think we should use the chance that europe can also send a signal for less red tape . 
 the second point is the question of law enforcement . 
 in order to obtain a legal culture in europe , no doubt that the law must be applied not only to the commission , by central institutions , but also by national authorities , by national courts . 
 we are not discussing that every eu law will always decided centrally , but in the adjustment we will have legal uncertainty . 
 it is certainly in the expected legislative process necessary to develop an instrument , so that companies have legal certainty and you have the opportunity to turn to the commission . 
 it should be the way to a european federal trade commission left open that will certainly be discussed in the future . 
 but we need more transparency in the competition policy . 
 the parliament must be more involved , and i also believe that if we introduce a register in which we can understand what state services are delivered , this will lead to discipline in the member states . 
 however , i have for the future of the competition two points are very dear to my heart . 
 one is the subject of subsidiarity . 
 we are all of the opinion that competition is necessary for the economy and the efficiency , and i think we should also allow the competition in the regions . 
 the competition between the regions will certainly strengthen and not weaken the european union . 
 i would cite as an example the issue ga - promotion , the example of savings and landesbanken , the example of the mark . 
 a region has its own force , created in order to market their own products . 
 this initiative should not be destroyed by european level . 
 i also think an increase of de minimis is necessary . 
 we should do everything that between the regions will compete . 
 the second is a discussion about competition and the social market economy , and i am not failure of speech here . 
 the area of regional and savings , i have already indicated , but i am now on the tip , was always on the one side or the other . 
 a people of a altenheimes is today housed in the social sphere . 
 i can see him but also as a customer , and i think we should fairly clear and timely to discuss where the social field , evolved structures stifle competition . 
 otherwise , i can any customers here , any sector , as customers , and will destroy very much social areas . 
 schliesslich , i would like to say to the principle of subsidiarity . i believe it is imperative that where member states allow regions and local authorities , to raise taxes , they will be preserved and not uniform of europe . 
 thank you , sir . 
 i would like to congratulate you on what is in german parliamentary inappropriately in your case a maiden speech . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am speaking on behalf of my colleague , robert goebbels , unfortunately , cannot be here due to a political commitment . 
 within the framework of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , jonckheer report has sparked sharp controversy on the question of the functioning of the market . 
 a slim right - wing majority has succeeded in the report removed any reference to the shortcomings of the market . 
 should parliament majority this ultra - liberal concept of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the world . 
 the economic relations in the real world made it abundantly clear that eliminating every state intervention in the market does not lead to a perfect competition and an optimal allocation of resources . 
 the market was the preferred austauschort of people since ancient times , but never perfect . 
 the market favours the short - term business and quick profits . 
 the balance of power between supply and demand on the market in general to the detriment of the weakest , consumers and workers . 
 in order to function , the market needs rules . 
 the necessary and valuable enterprise needs as a sense of responsibility towards society . 
 we , as the european social democrats are in favour of a social market economy . 
 the market is not an end in itself , it must serve the improvement of the living conditions . 
 the european union , the member states should not take the place of the economic operators , but the authorities must define the rules and objectives , which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion . 
 aid can ultimately serve to facilitate restructuring , offer training , jobs and know - how to save . 
 the main objective of the union 's competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level . 
 this aid to the objectives of the union , especially in the economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research , . 
 the commission must unrechtmässigen aid and , in fact , hinder the internal market , the fight . 
 however , it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all state aid . 
 the internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research funded by the american army . 
 the world wide web , which has made possible the dizzying development of the information society , was also developed with state funding by cern in geneva . 
 the bailout of holzmann group the german federal government has been criticized as unjustifiable obstruction of the market economy . 
 duisenberg has even trying to blame this state interventionism in other äusserst relative weakness of the euro against the dollar . 
 i did not know that mr duisenberg to save the ltcm hedge fund criticized by the american authorities . 
 want to save 60 , 000 jobs , it is apparently a sin against the market , but the rescue of capital the advocates of the free market appears to be no problems . 
 public funds are used in order to repair the damage caused by the international speculation , as this was the case in mexico , in asia and brazil . 
 on the other hand , the human work is seen as a simple anpassungsfaktor . 
 social democrats , we reject this liberal legend . 
 we want a real culture of competition in europe . 
 the hand of the member states must remain visible in the control of the market , and the commission is the role of arbiter . 
 mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i would like mr rapkay thank for his good report and good cooperation . 
 commissioner monti , i thank you for the excellent cooperation , at the same time , i would like to point out that you have just to turn an especially important role , because they need to tidy up the mistakes of the national governments , in relation to the competition policy have large vision . 
 in all imagination but the damage they can do , we can hardly imagine . i can refer to the recent examples . 
 we have a case of holzmann . this company receives considerable aid from the german government , ; sawmills in former east germany , and last but not least , aid to shipyards . 
 in these areas , many danish companies have problems and will be out of the market . 
 poos , i would like to say that i agree with mr duisenberg . there are examples of some eu member states are not in a position to change their economic structure and undermine the value of the euro . 
 the liberal group has 80 amendments in the committee , all with state aid . 
 these proposals which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which are very important for the functioning of the internal market . 
 i would like to take this opportunity and my colleagues in the committee for their support for the proposals of the liberal group . 
 it is in our proposals , as i said , in order to ensure transparency , and i would like to stress the amendment , which calls on the commission to present uniform criteria and conditions for rechtmässige state aid , so that the companies assess their situation . 
 it also needs to be clarified , what to do when state aid for unrechtmässig said . 
 how can we ensure that unrechtmässige state aid be returned ? 
 at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we urge the commission to , for the harmonisation of the rules to ensure repayment . 
 this is the right way to similar to create competition . 
 we also propose a register , as mentioned by some members , and also a scoreboard , which is evident from the level of the countries regarding the state aid . 
 we have here , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard . 
 this has inspired us , propose the same for state aid . 
 commissioner monti , i very much hope that you will support this proposal , and i look forward to your comments and opinion . 
 abschliessend begrüsse i the xxviii . the commission 's competition , the earlier reports as well . 
 but , as i said , our primary aim must be , transparency and openness . 
 we must constantly develop transparency and openness of the state aid and direct our efforts targeted to these areas . this is important not least for the forthcoming enlargement . 
 i would like to thank mr jonckheer , deals with the associated problems in his report very thoroughly . he looked at how we can ensure that these countries can meet our requirements , but also as a level playing field . 
 of course , liberal and green are different view of how the world should be , but we are largely agree on the objectives and will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems . 
 mr president , commissioner , we simply have to answer two questions . 
 are legitimate state aid for companies or agreements between companies in a market economy , and who is going to control these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ? 
 on the first point , we say very clearly that , if the needs of sustainable development , the european union , should be taken into account , the state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemptions , special taxation or simply direct aid . 
 it also is legitimate , that there are inter - company agreements , which allow the negative effects of competition on the social or environmental demands to reduce . 
 so , we say clearly and , yes , it is legitimate that it aid and that there can be agreement , but we also say that each of these agreements must be expressly justified . 
 von wogau , proposed in the report , the monitoring the legitimacy of such measures in the national competence . 
 we feel this is a degree of risk , but nonetheless vote for it , because we see that the commission cannot do everything . 
 we demand that the great transparency and that the commission will be granted greater powers of investigation , to check the legitimacy of such exceptions . 
 mr president , once again we are debating the competition policy of the european union . 
 however , the conditions under which this debate is taking place and what we should draw conclusions ? 
 the current situation is marked by huge mergers and acquisitions involving huge monopolies and the emergence of frighteningly powerful corporations . 
 we should not be discussing this issue ? 
 the competition will and can control these companies ? 
 certain european industries such as shipbuilding , aeronautics and the steel industry are already competitive measures , have suffered substantial losses . 
 they have a significant positions and shares on the world market and hundreds of thousands of jobs eingebüsst . 
 whether we will also have to deal with at some point . 
 the scandalous concentration of power in strategically important sectors provides the economy of entire countries , and member states of the union - the only profit - oriented multinationals . 
 however , we are pushing for a further weakening of the public sector and are prepared to tighten up the competition policy yet , even state contracts to companies in the public by hand as state aid . 
 on the other hand , the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs to an explosive rise in unemployment . 
 the workers see a massive attack on their employment and social rights . 
 the consumers see their standard of living is falling , poverty spreading and the public sector and the productive basis in most countries of the union in the name of a savage and destructive competition for the benefit of the full market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of grosskapitals ruined and disbanded . 
 in our opinion , is responsible for the competition policy which we are determined to put up a fight . 
 mr president , commissioner , in the course of this crucial year before the introduction of the common currency , the commission has made all efforts in order to create favorable conditions for the euro . 
 this has also helped the competition policy within the framework of these opportunities . 
 as far as we are concerned , we are still strongly opposed to the single currency , the us advantages and flexibility of a common currency , but missed a straight - jacket of the european nations imposed upon us . 
 governance that planning and responsibility in this new context which has been forced upon us , and of course the competition plays an important role . 
 the commission has set several priorities in this area : influencing the market by actively combating of anti - competitive practices , ausschliessliche orientation must clearly its services on matters of common interest as well as signalling their desire to modernise the competition law . 
 what the state aid , so it is important to ensure that this instrument not too slow , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid be covered , does not seem desirable to us because this onerous commitment would automatically all attempts to run counter to the removal of bureaucratic constraints . 
 what schliesslich the modernisation of the application of article 85 and 86 of the treaty , so we believe that would be a decentralised application is not the right way . 
 the commission maintains it is not only the right to take a matter of competence of the national authorities , but the national courts are clearly committed , to avoid any conflict with the decisions of the commission .
