Resumption of session I declare on Friday the 17th December adjourned session of the European Parliament resumed, once again wish you a Happy New Year and hope you had nice holidays. As you were, the dreaded "Millennium - Bug" did not occur. But people in a number of countries suffered from terrible natural disasters have become. In Parliament, the desire for a debate during this session in the coming days. Today I would like to ask you - this is also the desire of some colleagues - to commemorate all victims of the storms, particularly in the various countries of the European Union, in a moment of silence. I ask you to observe a minute's silence. (The House rose and observed a minute's silence.) Madam President, point of order. As you probably know from the press and television that there were several bomb explosions in Sri Lanka with many deaths. The bombing victims who were there to complain in recent times in Sri Lanka, Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam includes, to the European Parliament had paid only a few months to visit. 
Would it be appropriate if you transmit to you, Madam President, the President of Sri Lanka in a letter the regrets of Parliament to the violent death of Mr. Ponnambalam and other citizens of Sri Lanka and ask them, would do everything in their power to after to seek a peaceful solution to this difficult situation? Yes, Mr. Evans, I think that such an initiative is quite appropriate. If the House agrees, I will follow the proposal of Mr Evans. Madam President, point of order. Could you give me advice about Rule 143 concerning the inadmissibility? My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday on the language and I will raise again. Parliament will on Thursday with the Cunha - deal report on multi-year orientation programs, the proposal in paragraph 6, that countries that do not meet their target for fleet reduction should be introduced annually with a sort of quota penalties. And although this should be done despite the principle of relative stability. I mean, that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally invalid. I want to know whether it is possible to raise an objection to a document in which it is merely a report and not a legislative proposal, and whether I am entitled to do so on Thursday. 
That's when you can if you wish, raise that matter, on Thursday opened the debate on the report. Madam President, This year's first meeting of the European Parliament is unfortunately connected with the fact that in the United States, Texas, on Thursday this week, the execution of a sentence of death 34 year-old young man named Hicks has been established. Upon request, a French member, Mr Zimeray, has already filed a petition has been signed by many, including myself. According to the European Parliament and of the European Union is now constantly represented and foremost I would like to ask, however, the whole influence of your office and the institution you represent, at the presidential candidate and Texas Governor George W. Bush, the suspending the execution of the sentence and the power to pardon the convicted to make claims. All of this conforms to the principles that we have always upheld. Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do it gladly. This is in line with the position we have represented in Parliament ever. Madam President, I would draw your attention to a case with which this Parliament has dealt repeatedly. This is the case of Alexander Nikitin. 
We are happy here all that the court acquitted him and made it clear that constitutional law in Russia, access to environmental information. Now it is so that he should be re-tried because the prosecutor is appealing. We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions - especially during the last plenary session of last year - that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin crime and betrayal, because we are directly affected by his results have a benefit. These results are the basis for the European programs to protect the Barents Sea, and so I ask you a draft letter to you the most important facts to consider, and in accordance with the decisions of Parliament in Russia to make this position clear. Schroedter, I'm happy to look into the facts when I received your letter. Madam President, thank you that you have kept your word and that in the first session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed enormous. But, Madam President, has not complied with my request. Although there are now two Finnish and one Portuguese, still no Dutch channels. I had requested a Dutch channel, because we Dutch like to watch the news when we come here every month sent into exile. I would therefore once again request you to ensure that a Dutch channel as well. Plooij woman - van Gorsel, I can tell you that this item was on Wednesday on the agenda of Quaestors. 
I hope that will be examined in a sense. Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes? Why is the air quality was not in this building since we were elected only once? Why Health and Safety Committee has not met since 1998, even once? Why has not the Brussels or the Strasbourg parliament building fire drill took place? Why are there no fire instructions? Why was after my accident done nothing to make the stairs safe? Why is not enforced in the smoking areas? It is a shame that we pass legislation to which we adhere to it yourself. Mrs. Lynne, you are quite right, and I will check if all this really is. 
I will also submit the question to the Quaestors. I am sure that these be keen to ensure that we have the legislation we adopt, observe yourself. Madam President, Mrs. Díez González and I had tabled questions on specific, in a Spanish newspaper opinions of the Vice-President de Palacio. The competent services have not been included in the agenda because they felt they had been answered in a previous session. I ask you to reconsider this decision because this is not the case. The questions answered previously, based on the occurrence of Mrs de Palacio in a specific matter, most not on the 18th November last year statements published in the daily newspaper ABC. Dear colleague, we will look into it. But I must say that I think the situation at the moment to be somewhat confused. We will look into it very carefully, so that everything is all right. Madam President, I wonder if the parliament this week a strong message of our dissatisfaction with today's decision to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia refused to send out is, considering that the vast majority in Parliament in the past for has issued arms embargo against Indonesia. Today's decision not to renew the ban holds, given the situation there is a very great danger. 
The Parliament should, since that is the wish of the vast majority, send a message. The refusal to renew the embargo by the EU - Member States is irresponsible. As noted above, the situation in Indonesia is extremely unstable. There is even a risk of a military coup. We do not know what happened. So why should the EU arms producers reap profits at the expense of innocent people? This question is not provided for the emergency debate on Thursday. Work Plan The next item is the final draft of the agenda as provided for in Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure on Thursday the 13th January by the Conference of Presidents has been set. Monday and Tuesday to make any changes. 
Wednesday: The Socialist Group requested that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the reform of the Commission in the agenda. I ask the applicant, Mr Barón Crespo, to justify its request, if he so wishes. We then proceed as usual: a speaker for and one against. Madam President, The idea of the political program of the Prodi Commission was for the entire term back to a proposal from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who took the unanimous approval of the Conference of Presidents in September, and the express approval of President Prodi, his commitment in his inaugural speech affirmed. This commitment is important in that the Commission is a body that has sole right of initiative under the treaties and thus fundamentally shapes the political and legislative activities of Parliament in the next five years. I would also remind you that this Parliament in the previous Parliament President Prodi twice to express its confidence in this election period, it spoke to him again in July from his trust, and then when the new Commission, it was announced in September again a vote of confidence for the whole Commission. Thus, the Commission had already sufficient time to develop its program, and for us to get to know it and explain it to our citizens. In this regard, I recall the resolution of 15 submitted September, with the recommendation of the proposal in the shortest possible time. The events of last week - on the margins of the Conference of Presidents, beginning with this conference and only for the confirmation and ratification of decisions taken elsewhere used - highlight a dilemma: either the Commission is not able to present this program (in this case, they should clarify it. 
According to its President, it is capable of. Since the Commission by Vice President de Palacio, is represented, I think it appropriate, before the vote, the Commission's position regarding its willingness to present this program, as it was agreed to learn. ), Or the Parliament is to examine this program is not able, as some appear to be. In my opinion, would this second hypothesis waiver of our responsibility as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method, which consists of making groups the keynote address to the Commission in written form a week earlier - and not, as agreed, the day before - to give notice, bearing in mind is that the legislative program will be discussed in February, so that we could forego the debate, as the press and the Internet on the day would have to inform all citizens about this and Parliament will no longer have to deal with the matter. My Group believes that there is a parliament to listen, discuss and reflect, in our view, there is no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the Commission is able to do so, we still have the time the original agreement between the Parliament and the Commission should be reinstated in power and responsibility to our fellow citizens that may be. Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which you have mentioned, on Wednesday maintained as a scheduled performance of the program of the Prodi Commission for the term, and included in this program and the administrative reform project, as we otherwise in a paradoxical situation could find themselves: on the pretext that the wording of products does not constitute a part, is the President of the Commission denied the right to speak in Parliament, and also would a debate be held on the reform, without this House previously could read the texts that the debate is based. I therefore ask you to consult President, the Commission to comment now, and then to the vote. (Applause from the PSE - Group) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen! I am quite astonished at the conduct of Mr Barón Crespo is now asking that this agenda item on the agenda for Wednesday. Mr Barón Crespo, you were not on the last Thursday in the Conference of Presidents will be present. I do not criticize, it happens every time that someone to represent them. 
Mr Hänsch you represented there. We have been in the Conference of Presidents a detailed debate. Your Group is responsible to what you say. We then matched. Each each chairman has so many votes as the group has members. There was a vote on this issue. This vote is, I recall, the outcome was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions. That is, all the groups except the non-attached - but these are not a Group - were in agreement, only your Group thought to proceed in the way you have proposed here. All the others had a different opinion. That was the decision. 
Now I want to issue itself. We trust the Commission to Romano Prodi, and the vast majority of our group has Romano Prodi and the Commission, after a difficult process, as everyone knows, the confidence. But we also believe that we need to have a debate on the strategy of the Commission in an orderly fashion, not only because of an oral statement to the European Parliament, but also because of a document which is adopted in the Commission and for this program describes five years. There is no such document! The Commission will present its program for 2000 in February. We said, o. k, if the Commission does not wish to program 2000 in January, we'll do it in February. We have agreed to this. We want to be no quarrel with the Commission, but we believe if at all possible, Commission and Parliament must agree on the path. But we in Parliament and the Controller of the Commission. And not everything that comes from the Commission, must be our opinion. I want us to prepare ourselves to do a reasonable debate on the five-year program in the fractions. 
You can not prepare, if you hear a statement and did not know what content is of such a declaration. It is therefore our recommendation - and my impression is that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we have in February, the debate about the long-term program of the Commission until the year 2005 - I hope the Commission will by then agree on a program that they will propose to us - and that we are having at the same time in February, the debate on the Legislative Commission for the year 2000. So it is a reasonable factual context, which advises us to hold the debate on both programs together. Therefore, my group rejects the proposal by the Socialist Group decided! (Applause from the PPE - DE - Group) I suggest that we vote on the request of the Socialist Group, the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated on the agenda. (The House rejected the request.) The President. To Wednesday I still have a further request relating to the oral question on the capital gains tax. The PPE / DE - Group is requesting that this item be on the agenda. Does anyone want the application on behalf of the Group to propose? 
Madam President, I can hear from the Socialists a ripple of laughter - I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group to have the item keen to have removed because the vote in the Conference of Presidents of the vote of the working group of relevant colleagues in the Socialist Group did not exist. I do not know if this information is correct, but we as EPP - ED - Group would, in any case be grateful if this item were removed, because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already. There are also resolutions against such a tax. That is why my group to put this item on the agenda. Thank you, Mr Poettering. We now turn to Mr. Wurtz, who speaks against the motion. Madam President, I would first like to point out that not what Mr Poettering said there is quite logical. First, he taught the Socialist Group, because this is a very clear and unequivocal decision of the Conference of Presidents in question. And now he is doing exactly the same. We have discussed, we agreed, but the EVP - Group and the Liberals. And I had also pointed out that fellow chairmen will still remember that it is not about whether or not to Tobin - tax, but whether we are ready to hear what the Commission and the Council keep them. 
That's not too much to ask. So I repeat the suggestion that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained for you to learn once and for all the positions of these two institutions for this relatively modest proposal, which would give the public an important signal, in particular after the excitement entourage the failure of the Seattle Conference. We now vote on the request of the PPE / DE - From Group to sell the oral question on capital tax from the agenda. (The House rejected the request, with 164 - votes, 166 no - votes against and 7 abstentions.) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for stirring the big drum in favor of this debate. Thank you. Madam President, Is my voice been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, because I do not have a card. I have "it" in tune. In fact, if you add the two members who have declared themselves, then it follows as a result ... 
Madam President, The Presidency has declared the result of the vote. Changes are not possible. Madam President, in the earlier vote on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission - do not worry, I will abide by your ruling on this matter - I had asked to speak before the vote on behalf of my group. That did not happen. I would appreciate it if I had to conclude this item of business opportunity, on behalf of my group to make a statement on the vote. This is an important matter. Perhaps it would be useful for, is like what we have just done, taken by the individual in light of their own political analysis. Madam President, I will not take up the debate again, but I had also reported to take on the request of Mr Barón Crespo position. You have not call me either. I regret this, but the vote was conducted, the decision is made, so we let things. 
I'm sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I had not seen that you had asked to speak. However, the positions are quite clear and are included in the minutes. If we adopt the minutes of the morning session today, the ladies and gentlemen who are of the view that the positions are not sufficiently clear to apply changes. I think this approach is adequate. Course, the Minutes of the meeting tomorrow into account any additional explanations. I think this is better than the current long explanations of votes. Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, you agree? Madam President, if properly from the vote stating how my group has voted, shall not, and I can not say anything about it. If you set that I can give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations. 
When drafting the protocol, we will proceed with great care. We do, of always. If items are not displayed properly, we can change the protocol if necessary. (The House approved the revised work plan.) Security consultant for the transport of dangerous goods The next item is the report (A5 - 0105 / 1999) by Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on minimum requirements for the safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways (C5 - 0208 / 1999 - 1998 / 0106 (COD)). Dear Commissioner, dear President, ladies and gentlemen! I welcome the Council's common position on the harmonization of training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway. First, we needed to take formal action to the requirements of Directive 96 / 35 / EC meet, the Member States to appoint safety officers and safety advisers and to organize the training, instruction and examination of these people, without explicitly perform . Secondly, we achieved with this directive a) an increase in safety, both in shipment and during handling of dangerous goods, b) a reduction of distortion due to wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) the equalization of opportunities by security advisers on the European labor market. Third, we guarantee with the Directive as it currently exists as a common position, especially since they are restricted to minimum standards, a high degree of flexibility and minimal regulation by the European Union, and we contribute to the high responsibility of Member States. All this is welcome in the spirit of subsidiarity extraordinary. 
Our amendments from first reading, I think taken into account very satisfactorily. They were transferred or transposed with or they rejected because the corresponding European regulations have not been included, z. As a system of penalties for violations or a complex form of questions. The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, concerning the timetable for implementing the directive, I ask you to vote. By setting the Member States to implement the Directive no specific date, but they concede a period of three months after entry into force, we introduce a flexibility clause, which guarantees an immediate implementation. I ask for your consent. Madam President, We can not and must not accept the fact that we hear more and more accidents caused by those on the street, but also by rail or waterway great loss, not only, but also because the victims not the transit of dangerous goods seriously take enough or because of ignorance or lack of training for drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles from a minor accident is all too often become a major disaster. Me as an Austrian, but I think we all have the disaster in living memory, which has killed last year in the Tauern many lives and had to be rebuilt where then many months with an incredible financial burden, which was destroyed in the fire in the tunnel is. The month-long renovation, cut off this important route between the north and the south of Europe. The diverted because of traffic has many thousands of EU - citizens charged to the limit of endurance. It was in some communities in my country is truly going to hell. 
Prevention must be our response to such disasters, and with this draft directive is to create an important basis for the well-trained security officers are available, so that in time the thing is done. We must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety. We must also consistently that our rules are transposed by the Member States, and more importantly, we must ensure that they are applied afterwards. Please not another area in which we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement. One last point I would like to address something else: we must not content ourselves with close to another gap in the safety net and close their eyes to the fact that the issue of road safety in Europe to do more. I ask in this context and ask the Commissioner responsible, as soon as possible submit a text to ensure a future of greater security in the tunnel traffic, so that we in Europe no longer have to experience such a disaster on this scale Madam President, I wish to thank Mr. Koch for his report that the road safety topic. The report deals with the harmonization of testing requirements for safety advisers in the field of transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways are active. I congratulate him on his excellent report. Transport safety in the news recently, the negative headlines: The rail crash near London's Paddington station, the terrible train accident in Norway, two airplane crashes in which EU - were people injured, and caused by the Erika off the Brittany coast natural disaster events, The last alone in the four months were reported. They make clear that road safety is not a matter of course and that those responsible for public protection must be highly motivated and highly qualified. 
The rapporteur noted that the Council's common position has taken six of the ten first reading in Parliament's amendments and that the other amendments to the Parliament have been considered essentially. My group will support the Common Position and therefore welcomes the enactment of the legislation, which will be another tool in the fight to make improving road safety in the EU. Initiatives to improve road safety will always support any of my group. As recent events show, there are in this area to do very much. Madam President, allow me a few comments. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his highly accurate and technical report and the Commission for the proposal put forward by her. It is the alignment of requirements and tests, but actually also to minimum standards. In a sense I regret that. Of course, comes to road safety to road, rail and inland waterways is of key importance, and given the international nature of these shipments, it is necessary to harmonize the training for safety representatives as well as requirements such as new ADR. I think that is just as important for the implementation. Of course there are good reasons why we must pay particular attention to this. 
Think of the accidents that have occurred in recent years on the road. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries lorries carrying dangerous goods continued despite fog and were not, as it were, given the circumstances really they should shut down the road. Or think of ships from Eastern Europe ships that anchor here in addition to other risks that this obvious dangers. Also transpired that in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japanese ports that 50% of containers with some dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly. In short, a serious problem. In terms of security advisers, so in some countries since 1 January this year, such a Consultant required by company. The reaction is present, especially in small companies with difficulties, because they can not afford such a site. Either they sell their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which leads to a number of problems. Therefore be required, the details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analysis and possible inclusion in the certification to ISO 9002. The real work is done, now it's about implementation. Let me mention one final point. 
In regard to enforcement, we must also make appropriate arrangements with the Eastern European countries, as from 1 July 2001, and a half years, will join the relevant conventions. This gives them a temporary competitive advantage. This is not in itself bad not think we should, in particular the safety aspects of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate that part of the acquis as soon as possible and present the candidate countries. Madam President, rightly, the Parliament is concerned with the regular traffic safety. The ever-increasing volume of goods transported in Europe is open, or hidden is a threat to the staff and the community. People who are confronted with these risks, should therefore meet stringent requirements. With this in another policy, 95 / 35 / EC, set out standards should advise people to be responsible manner on the carriage of dangerous goods. To my delight, is also consistent with the Council on minimum requirements for their review, although I would have preferred with the aim to equivalent qualifications uniform mandatory standards and regulations. However, this seems to be not feasible. In sum, I think, tabled by the rapporteur Amendment in all respects to be logical and therefore can support it fully. 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports, which may be technical reports, but for the safety of very great importance. I just want to make a few comments. First I would ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - that is the question of safety, whether to give the road on the waterways or at sea, increased attention. When I see that the first request of the Commission on 19 March 1998 was made and we are dealing with it today - even though Parliament has responded relatively quickly - then this period is too long. That is not just the fault of the Commission, but I think we have to react quickly so to come to a harmonization. The second point has already been mentioned: the minimum standards. In principle, I believe that in many areas of transport increased flexibility and country should strive for rules. For the safety, I am a little skeptical because the security such as in Sweden in principle not different from that in Germany, Italy or Austria. I can live with these minimum standards, but I ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully. If this type of flexibility should lead to inadequate rules in some countries, we should work towards greater harmonization. 
The third point has already been mentioned. I come, like Mr rack from a transit country where this issue plays a special role. We do not want to worsen the conditions of competition for some countries unilaterally and better for countries like Austria or other transit countries. But I think we should do all to keep the transport of dangerous goods as low as possible, and in all countries, transit countries or not. Mr. President, First and foremost I would like the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, on his great work and its constructive cooperation with the Commission in improving the text, presenting this report and this proposal, and ultimately there is only one amendment to the requirements for the examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways. We believe that cooperation, the joint work of both institutions - Parliament and Commission - important, and with the Committee on Regional Policy existing cooperation, specifically with the transport group, excellent. The common position includes practically all covered by the Commission accepted the amendments, the minimum requirements have been harmonized to the tests for the safety consultant, and second reading, we can adopt the amendment to the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally proposed by the Commission, when you consider that we have now spent several years on this question. Very briefly, I want to thank the contributions of the various deputies and you, ladies and gentlemen, say that the Commission of the Transport Safety priority. And as Mr Simpson said very correctly, the process may never be complete, as won or finished as to be considered. The process of increasing the safety margins and guarantees in the transport sector is a process that must be improved day by day. 
In this context I would like to comment very briefly on the problems of the tunnels that have been raised by Mr Swoboda and the rack and the Austrian case, certainly a very sensitive issue, and efforts must be made to identify ways to increase security . see In one of the worst accidents in recent times, the charge was not dangerous in itself. The margarine and a couple of kilos of paint, which, in principle no risk, led to a real disaster. must therefore be examined, as the requirements to ensure maximum safety can be optimized yet. Finally, I would say that it comes to safety in all transport modes. This week we are here, because of the Erika disaster in a debate about the safety of maritime traffic, and we have later this year also discuss the security goals in aviation. I would like to say that safety is a priority of the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika, we are not waiting for a catastrophe for us to deal with the security aspect, but we are working in parallel with those events. This lead us, however, the urgency for an effective response to such problems in mind. I would like to repeat all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, my thanks. The debate is closed. 
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 clock. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5 - 0104 / 1999) by Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (COM (1999) 158 - C5 - 0004 / 1999 - 1999 0083 (COD)), amending Directive 94 / 55 / EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States for the transport of dangerous goods by road. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! On 1 January 1997 includes Directive came into force on the approximation of laws of the Member States for dangerous goods transported by road are some transitional provisions, the validity period and at the conclusion of certain standardization work of CEN, ie the European Committee for Standardization, is coupled. Delays in the work of the CEN are now making it difficult to apply this same policy. In particular, annexes not be adapted to the technical and industrial development. I regret this because we have to act, because others have not done their work. In this respect, I accept this proposal for discussion today and amending Directive 94 / 55 / EC. Inaction of the European Union would oblige Member States to amend their national legislation for a brief period, pending completion of the work of CEN, which would cause unnecessary costs and uncertainty. Up on today's agenda amending the Directive does not therefore affect the existing community in the harmonization of transport of dangerous goods. 
It merely prolongs the transition rules by postponing deadlines, they are no longer sweeps applicable terms, and lays down the procedures for a) ad hoc - transportation of dangerous goods and b) the adoption of less stringent national regulations, to locally particularly in the transport of very small amounts of dangerous strictly limited areas. The amendment to the directive is in line with the subsidiarity and Member States will receive more powers. The EU - Commission decides whether Member States may impose specific rules of their own. She will be assisted by a committee of experts on hazardous materials in accordance with the regulatory procedure. The procedures for the exercise of these powers on the Commission for implementation has been redefined by the Council Decision of June 1999. Today we are discussing a proposal to amend the Directive on hazardous materials is on the street but in May 1999 and could not therefore take account of the current comitology. The submitted and the Committee unanimously adopted the amendments relate to two cases on this very changed comitology. We want to ensure that there is already mentioned in the preamble clearly worded and the period within which the Council adopted a decision must be set at a maximum of three months. It also makes clear the need for increased transparency. Another amendment allows Member States to stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks to adopt when working primarily at temperatures well below minus 20 ° C and transported. 
This is of particular interest to northern European regions. A final amendment is intended to ensure that the use of between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive is brought into use tanks and tankers allow the continued, if they have been constructed and maintained in accordance. However, knowing that this is only a small step on road safety, I ask you to consent to this report. Mr. President, Dear colleagues! I wish you a happy new year and millennium. I am speaking for the first time in Parliament and so this is quite exciting, a little like the first love, although that did last longer than two minutes. I want to comment on the Commission proposal amending the Directive on dangerous goods transported by road, in my opinion briefly. I think it is good to adopt this policy now because otherwise modify the Member States of their legislation for a very short period, a transition phase would, cause mean unnecessary costs and which turn once more increase the citizens through the bureaucracy of the EU would . In the proposal the commission will not take into account all relevant issues, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions. That is why I have tabled some amendments to the principle excellent report of Mr. Koch, which have been adopted by our committee. My amendments relate to the frost resistance of shipping containers for dangerous goods. 
Under the Commission proposal, a limit of -20 ° C would be sufficient. On the Mediterranean, it's hard to imagine that in Lapland much lower temperatures achieved. Even in Lapland, the EU is supported, so we must also remember them. My suggestion to reduce the frost to -40 oC. This would be necessary to maintain the level of security in the northern regions. I hope that my proposal will be in tomorrow's vote into account. Mr. President, with your permission I would like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way you have just now during the debate on the quick changeover of the presidency. I thought that was quite outstanding. On the subject: I think that the people of Europe must be able to rely on that what is on Europe's roads, rails, etc., transported, even if it is still dangerous goods for, as safe as possible. This directive is a contribution. 
What we do today is basically a nuisance. The rapporteur Koch, to whom we express our thanks for his work he has done on this, pointed out that basically everything could have been something more if it were not for this failure of the CEN, in the creation and adapting the directive are very delinquent. Therefore, we can only hope - and we should be the same this week decide everything - that we have then 2001 finally common regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road, so we have a piece of legal certainty and a bit more safety on our roads. Mr. President, The report we are discussing today has, in fact any major changes to the episode, as most of the amendments are purely technical. It should be emphasized that such decisions always make a positive contribution to environmental protection and thus improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market. In the EU, large quantities of dangerous goods by road, rail and waterways to be transported, and for that we need effective legislation. Now we get for all possible areas of common minimum rules for the Member States, which is very welcome. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, for his work on this issue. This is also for the conditions of the internal market are concerned. 
For a really functioning common market, we need not only traffic laws in general, but as uniform rules. Let me conclude by commenting on a third matter, which I think also of significance, the amendment by Mr Ari Vatanen. The conditions in each Member State to another. The adoption of this amendment, we take into account the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the Union. The effects of cold on materials and packaging must not be ignored. Mr. President, I consider it positive that this scheme can be implemented flexibly and hope the Commission will adopt this change. Mr. President, I would like to thank not only Mr Cook, but also the Vice President of the Commission that she has known so straight to the security of transport, and priority of security. Mr Koch has done a good report because in the CEN and in the Economic Commission of the United Nations, the work was done not so expeditiously. I want to ask the Vice President, whether they tell us today what the state of play in the harmonization efforts of these two organizations, and whether the EU has the opportunity to accelerate the harmonization efforts to the simplest principles. For it is clear that even if we come within the European Union a great scheme, the traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond that. 
Therefore, further, that further regional arrangements are certainly useful. If the Commissioner is not make today can, they would be prepared to inform the committee in writing the state of affairs and the state of negotiations between CEN and the Economic Commission? Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Koch once again for his work on this other report, which adds in a sense, the pronunciation of October on the rail. We all regret that the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has not been able to perform in the required time, the necessary rules change for a required harmonization within the European Union. This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate different elements which demonstrate the diversity of Europe of ours. A few moments ago, Mr Vatanen of temperatures which are not of 20 degrees below zero, but less than 40 degrees below zero. Of course we accept that amendment, it is absolutely right, and I think it must be considered in specific situations, the evidence of the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the establishment of standards and technical characterizations of specifics and concrete requirements are implemented. To the words of Mr Swoboda on the activities of CEN, I would say that we urge them to speed up their work, for it would be tragic if we, despite the new deadline for something more than a year would face the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded. Finally, Mr. President, are the basic problems have been pointed out that justify this change of policy, we are on the delay in the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions of the agreement between the wording of the directive and the contents of the attachments and the need made to be more specific. All contributions to the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, which are in different, specifically four amendments are expressed, acknowledged by the Commission. 
We therefore accept that we submitted four amendments. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 clock. Coordination of Structural Funds / Cohesion Fund The next item is the report (A5 - 0108 / 1999) of the Schroedter on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission Communication: The Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund - Guidelines for programs in the period 2000-2006 (COM (1999) 344 - C5 - 0122 / 1999 - 1999/2127 (COS)). Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that my first post is dedicated to the European Parliament to a subject that in the part of the United Kingdom, which I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales, is considered the most important issue at all. As you know, a considerable part of Wales under the Structural Funds Programme of the status of an Objective 1 region has been assigned. So expect a lot of people in Wales that the European Structural Funds will help in overcoming some of the great difficulties that we have to fight without a doubt. Poverty in Wales continues to increase, particularly since 1997 where it is rising sharply. The gap between rich and poor is ever widening. 
We hope, therefore, the Structural Funds program is not only an economic restructuring, but a wider improvement of the economic base of the country part. What makes us create hard, however, is the fact that the granting of assistance under the Structural Funds is recorded as something of a success of the government. It's just another example of the immense difficulties that Wales faces. I would therefore like to highlight some of the issues that the Commission should give priority. We expect the Commission to deal with points in the context of additionality. We believe it is wrong that the figures are sunk in a way, the figures for the United Kingdom. We expect the Commission that there is matched funding for projects. We expect them to challenge the UK Government to ensure that the private sector, which undoubtedly constitute the driving force in relation to the provision of funds under the Structural Funds must be involved in the planning. Finally, we urge the Commission to provide for more transparency in the expenditure of Structural Funds money. Too much of what happened in this Parliament, there is a lack of transparency. 
This is an area in which the Commission, I believe can be a very great friend of Wales. Mr. President, Our committee views these issues from many different angles. First I would like to speak about the research aspect. We consider it very positive that the rapporteur has taken account of our committee in its findings, extended that in the cohesion countries, the scientific infrastructure needs by universities and educational institutions will be set in such places where they are better than before the inhabitants of underdeveloped regions are available, and graduates will be easier to remain in their home regions. This is made possible by state action, and such a decentralization of higher education will be a useful policy for a balanced development. In another question to which we wish to draw particular attention from the perspective of industrial policy, we would have wished that the Commission in planning the coordination of cohesion and structural funds, the impact of the growth of the service sector, electronic commerce and Internet use would be considered. Poverty and wealth to depend more on the economic structure. Many were those regions where there were jobs in the industry. Now, from these regions in part become problem cases and poor areas, where investments in new industries such as electronics and services must be because they are considered forward-looking areas. This fact has not the committee's report into account in my view, sufficiently so that I would like to advise the Commission on behalf of the Committee on Industry. As the Committee on energy, we would finally have wished that the promotion of renewable energy resources from the cohesion - and the Structural Funds have played an even greater role. In this way, through the coordination would have the use of renewable forms of energy can be developed so that a lack of financial resources of the energy program for the larger funds will be compensated. Mr. President, I would Schroedter thank you very much for those it has worked on this issue. I would also like to say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Mrs Flautre that drafted the statement on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and is unfortunately ill. 
I would like to draw your attention to the amendments 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. It deals with the social economy and the need for the provision of social risk capital and the financial support of local programs to create employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion. Parliament viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment opportunities. These amendments are consistent with up to Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious problem that constructive action. We hope that those who call, which involve a rejection of these amendments into consideration, both in Parliament and in their job-seeking citizens of valid reasons for their decision. Mrs Flautre referred in its report on a topic that is sorely lacking coordination, yet desperately considerable coordination is needed. The Commission's proposals are based on the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five domain of the European Social Fund. But the lack of specific guidelines is the more regrettable as the idea of the ESF - link assistance to the employment strategy in the period 2000 - will be implemented first time in 2006. This omission gives the impression that the Commission does not know how to provide maximum coordination between the ESF - interventions after three and a half years subject to audit, and the annual National Action Plans for employment of the Member States to achieve it. We hope that we can convince the Commission that these are merely an oversight that will be corrected immediately. 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! Is by the Commission in fulfilling its mandate proposal submitted for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a reasonable starting point. However, I want to emphasize at this point that we this starting point, the challenges we face: the face of changes in the economic activities of all kinds due to the declining value of the agricultural sector within the various income sources of rural society, the population in rural areas to hold. Together with the shortcomings in infrastructure and in services and a generally very low, highly seasonal and not very diversified employment, exacerbates the migration from rural areas. The consequences do not wait. It is the young people who move, those who are getting an education and employment outside the rural areas, those effects in these regions are very unfavorable. This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and job creation. It must be borne in mind that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union. Agriculture represents only 5.5% of jobs in the Union. In addition, three quarters of our farmers and part-time farmers are dependent on additional sources of income. For this reason, it is one of the most important and far-reaching goals we should set in the European Union to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside the agricultural sector, including in sectors such as rural tourism, sports, culture, heritage of resources, restructuring of companies, new technologies, services, etc. But while agriculture is not exclusive role anymore, it is still important not only to prevent the economic and social decline of rural areas and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, conservation of biodiversity and the environment. 
We therefore advocate a policy of Agriculture and Rural Development, which is in line with our goals and ensure that the rural areas on the threshold of 21st Century must be competitive and multifunctional, both in terms of agriculture and with regard to opening of the diversity of non-agricultural activities. It is important to give general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, priority attention and to take into account the conclusions reached by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has entered into five main aspects that are only partially by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 have been taken. Finally, I would ask the Commission to consider these five points in the formulation of the conclusions of the four pillars, as are, in my view, the binding of the population in rural areas a priority objective of the European Union. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I would like to begin my speech by thanking Mrs Schröder, the rapporteur for the work. I mean, it's a very good job. I would also like to thank her for her willingness to dialogue with other factions in the search for a compromise formula in view of this avalanche of amendments and it may have been higher than expected, but they genuinely reflect the importance of the here treated Report. For us it is important that the conclusions adopted by this Parliament by the Commission, at least in spirit, be taken into account, because at this stage, it might appear that we are doing here is a useless, out nothing but hot air. However, we are of the view and this is reflected literally reflected in the conclusions that the Commission take into consideration the decisions of this House must, especially in view of the mid-term review of these guidelines. In our amendments, we have stated the importance we attach to the development of the necessary synergies between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community Initiatives, so that their application to optimal and most profitable way, the gradual elimination of regional inequalities and the creation of jobs which will that the two central objectives of the Fund are at issue here. Order that the objectives within a fast and effective stimulation, we believe it is necessary that the entrepreneurs, ie those who create the jobs show the true entrepreneurial spirit and actually ensure new sources of employment, be involved in this initiative. 
Especially small and medium entrepreneurs in the distribution of these funds must be included. If the entrepreneurs feel pushed to the edge on the other hand, if they do not cooperate, I can say now, not only in the administration, but also in receiving these funds, we will have a chance to accelerate the achievement of our objectives have lost. Equally important to achieving our goals, to overcome the disparities between regions and the development of jobs is the resolute commitment to new technologies, to transport - and communication networks and to renewable energies. And all this - and I mean the participation of the private sector, combined their efforts with those of public administrations, but they complement each other and never obstructing or excluding creates social wealth and jobs. Mr. President, I consider it my duty to remind my colleagues, Mr Evans, why Wales was even declared an Objective 1 region. This is the result of the questionable policies of his party, the Conservatives. Perhaps I should also remind him that his party leader, Mr Hague, when he was Minister for Wales, broke every rule in respect of the additionality that can only hurt, and from Commissioner Wulf - decided Mathies writing was called to order. I can assure you that the British government is well aware that for the Objective 1 regions of the principle of additionality. I suggest that Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation. My group has made extensive amendments to both reports under discussion today. 
I mean, we should focus on the central role of the guidelines. The idea is to create a framework and tool to support economic regeneration and to promote in order to use resources as effectively as possible and involving as many partners and pave the way for the regions economic recovery and sustainable development so that they can eventually be withdrawn from the financial drain. We need to find out the skills and potential of our regions in the high - tech - have sector. This is the face of media reports that Europe is promising for the High - Tech - lose growth industries of the United States more and more ground, even more important. The implementation of the last round of programs is also very instructive in that it illustrates, what guidelines should not go. It should not be about to create new bureaucratic obstacles. It should not be about to make half-way to change the priorities and policies, resulting in inevitable delays and under-utilization of the budgetary requirement. This is particularly in view of the new requirements for fiscal discipline is important. The implementation and application of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of this or that staff in the Commission or in the civil service. Within the competent Directorate of the Commission is to ensure uniformity, while at the same time to consider the specific local and regional aspects of the Commission programs. It therefore follows that we must strive for broad, indicative and flexible guidelines, on which both our program - managers and the beneficiaries will support and contribute to the maximum potential out of the new fields of regeneration. 
If we manage to stimulate entrepreneurial activity in our poor and underdeveloped regions, we will eventually get them the control and consolidate the confidence of investors materially. This follows a successful development, nothing more stands in the way. The success of these guidelines will be measured by whether the EU - regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, to open up new opportunities and absorbed that our poor and underdeveloped regions, a significant contribution to growth and prosperity making in the EU. Mr. President, Commissioner Dear colleagues! I thank Schroedter for an excellent report. She has dealt extensively with the issue and during treatment in the committee account of many to this report received amendments. Rightly, the Rapporteur also noted that Parliament was not heard in time to the guidelines. Now we are therefore very delayed. It is hoped that the opinions of Parliament in the mid-term and for the practical implementation is still useful. For the time, so here is the report during the treatment is too large when, with details and issues have been included that were contained in previous reports. 
In this phase, we must focus on how this process can be directed to the regional policy of the Union, with a view to the objective of reducing regional disparities. Our group stresses the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of regional partners in developing and implementing programs. For especially important to get to involve the small and medium enterprises in the planning and implementation of programs. Our Group also considers a greater recognition of overseas regions and other peripheral regions and would like to increase interaction between town and country. We are against the excessive control by the Union and the central governments of the Member States and calling for a reduction of bureaucracy in the development and implementation of programs. The success of projects to be implemented with the help of the union, is often compromised by slow decision-making and complex administrative procedures. In preparing the report, it was a stimulating discussion of the regional policy of the Union in general. This was our new members for the first time, and I see this as a very interesting process. Our group considers this report to be very good and supports it. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! As proof that this Parliament has a consultative and subordinate institution has not yet been overcome, was the excellent report by my colleague Mrs Elisabeth Schroedter not get into the Chamber because the regional development plans of the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions for several months lie in the working rooms of the Commission. 
In view of this, we must demand in Parliament in any case in which the Community support frameworks for the period in question in Parliament tested before they are adopted and discussed, on the basis of the guidelines that we present today, because we consider them particularly suitable to create jobs in the poorest and least developed regions, and we contribute to the negative, leading towards inequality trends in European society, so that we move towards a fairer Europe. Mr. President, We should not forget that the main strategic objective of the structure - lies and Cohesion Funds and their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion. It is our duty to take part in drafting the guidelines and also in assessing the results. For we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of citizens, not just in a Europe of states and regions. We also note that the Funds are a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic and social cohesion. If we take as a single indicator, the gross domestic product per capita, we can go wrong. Some colleagues have already talked about unemployment and the decline in population. It must be investigated, a number of indicators that will enable us to progress and the development of regional societies that that are in a worse situation than others. From some of the reports presented to the plenary, it is clear that unemployment accounts for the 25 most developed European regions, only a fifth of the unemployed in the 25 least developed regions. This means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission to take decisive strategic action. 
I also admit that Parliament had no opportunity - or not received, since the term came to an end - to talk about the guidelines. But I do not think the report is late. We need a common reflection, so that the new Objective 1 Programme and the regional development plans, which were drawn up before the effective date of the guidelines, a revision and actual evaluation may be subjected. It is necessary to coordinate the programs of the different objectives. We are all united in their demand that the Parliament, after half the period of implementation of these programs, if the evaluation of the guidelines is made, a major role to play, because we are the representatives of the citizens. Citizens can not accept that the European Union takes decisions in a, at least apparently, bureaucratic. It is necessary for them that the political dimension of work that are responsibilities that is communication with citizens. We are today asking the Commissioner. I think he is starting to agree on his previous experience as president of a region, that indicators and a strategy for economic and social cohesion and are proposed not only for productivity. Mr. President, I support the main proposals of the report in respect of the management of Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000 - 2006 and the main recommendations in the report. This includes, inter alia, that any time a unified approach to the use of EU funds - there must be structural and cohesion funds. This means that local authorities and national governments on the use of these funds need to work closely and in partnership. 
Member States are urged to attach integrated strategies to revive the relations between urban and rural areas, more important, and it is important to the rural areas especially. Although the renewal of our cities is very important, we must be careful in our policy always to strike a balance between the promotion of rural development and improving the lives of city residents. We can not go about creating a Europe of cities alone. The Structural Funds in particular through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks relevant to the development of rural and urban areas in the EU - countries contributed in the periphery. This process is in line with the heads of state - continued EU leaders at their summit in Berlin last year set spending guidelines, which the Parliament has approved at its May meeting. The most important of the EU from 1989 to 1993 and from 1994 to 1999 conducted programs could contribute greatly to improving the economic competitiveness of peripheral regions and Objective 1 regions in Europe. What matters now is that so far to consolidate achievements and to maintain the long term. This left the peripheral countries and regions in the outermost, ie the poorer regions in Europe, the opportunity to succeed in the new ¬ - marked and capital - area as well as on a further expanding and free with a commodity - people - services to operate the internal market. While major infrastructure projects under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund have been encouraged, but we should not forget that the European Social Fund has a very important role in helping the less affluent in our society. He has contributed to the improvement of facilities at tertiary level, to fund the leaving certificate programs and the establishment of comprehensive programs to combat youth and long - term unemployment, support for young people who leave school early, and combating illiteracy among serve adults. 
Mr. President, I was so far in relation to regional policy issues often disagree with the rapporteur, but this time I agree with her. Maybe this will encourage them to continue in this direction, in any case, I would like her but my congratulations. Secondly, we would have preferred it if the guidelines of the regulation had been annexed, as we had asked Ms McCarthy as rapporteur for the general regulation. Unfortunately, this is not done, but that does not Mr Bernie, but the old Commission is to blame. I'll just talk to it, because I once wanted to clarify the position of Parliament. Third, let me say that we agree with the guidelines on the whole, insofar as they do not deviate from our observations. They represent an essential tool for Member States. In particular I would like the Commission of sustainable development, job creation, with particular emphasis on equal opportunities and transport issues a high priority grants. I at least personally fully agree. As an islander, I would observe, however critical that the development of the islands is not recognized in their importance. This point is - once again - not being given the necessary attention: This has been going all the five years that I am a member of Parliament, and again I have pointed out the problem. 
We shall continue to have no rest, as Article 158, paragraph 1 of the Treaty of Amsterdam of a comprehensive policy for the islands of the question. The Commission must therefore address this issue at length. Moreover, it is really about time to implement the programs, and so must also the Member States meet their responsibilities and do their homework. As for us in Parliament is concerned, I would like to point adopted in May and for Parliament and the Commission's existing Code of Conduct. I am firmly convinced that this code will be maintained and kept Parliament informed of any developments and details concerning the implementation of the programs is ongoing. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my minute and a half I would first like to congratulate Mrs Schroedter. Many have indeed done that already, but I think she deserves it, for it has been found suggestions of one and the other side are very open and outgoing, and I think that this has been reflected in the quality of their report. I share the regret that the Parliament has become in relation to the guidelines practically on the moving train, as the negotiations with the states is so advanced that one can not assume that this report will have a direct impact. Therefore, I believe it is necessary that the Parliament thinks ahead and sets the guidelines for the review following the mid term in 2003 and should still try to influence the second phase from 2003. I mean, we are at the beginning of the planning period 2000 - 2006 are the requirements to be in the face two major challenges to be understood not as a routine matter. 
The first challenge is the harmonization of national development policies - and the regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to ensure development in the absence of infrastructure or public services. We must ask ourselves a fundamental question of how we can achieve integration of the policies with the subsidiary national planning policies. The second challenge is the extension that is, of course, both in geographical and budgetary point of view have a considerable impact. The Commissioner, I would ask, in these two actions are necessary and involve us. In light of recent natural disasters, I would just like to use the structural funds. We know that it is up to each State to allocate part of the funds themselves. It should not take it that - as is apparently the intention of the Member States - Europe no longer is in evidence. The public and the press accuse us today, not to appear, but where we are funding a large part of the effort at the level of individual states. I believe we can move saying this loud and clear. 
I also think that whenever Europe does help to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents, we find out about our assistance or ask Member States should take over this. Mr President, Finance - and monetary criteria priority given to reinforce inequalities of every kind. As far as French, for example, planning experts are now very likely that the regional disparities within each country further. However, the Structural Funds have helped to slow this development. Our aim is a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs, and this convergence of living conditions ahead of a rapprochement to the top. The implementation would certainly be an expansion of redistributive instruments such as the Structural Funds. We think in particular of a uniform capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds necessary for harmonization of social security and a reduction in working hours in Europe. But the Commission, which has the task to present guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner. The present report is now the policy back its true meaning. It is a step towards sustainable employment - and development policy. 
And so we will agree with him. Mr. President, Also I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work. Faced with the challenge of globalization and the eastward enlargement, Europe I think in the coming years for the programming and revitalize its economy more than ever appropriate detailed guidance. In this sense, the European Union are making as a whole and each Member State individually, by all means available to and possibilities, and thus also of the existing structure, optimal use of funds. Required for this is that the European Commission about the good intentions, clearer guidelines and specifically sought to control the use of those funds by Member States. In Italy, there were problems in recent years in the use of structural funds, the main reasons in a bloated bureaucracy, insufficient information and that it contained, that the economic - and social actors at the local level were not sufficiently involved. I would therefore like to advise the Commission on two points: First, the consultation will be an instrument of coordination and participation of all local and regional entrants in decisions optimally used specifically in order to avoid imbalances and inequalities; requires secondly, to simplify and make more transparent the administrative processes, which run too often unnecessarily long and so complicated that, what is contested mainly by the European SMEs, which represent a barrier to access to the fund. Finally, I think it is quite serious, that the territorial employment pacts and above all the arrangements for the control of women - and youth unemployment in the Commission Communication little attention has been paid. Mr. President, I take it as my colleague Mr Evans a particular pleasure for the first time in this House on this very important problem is the word, especially since I represent the West Midlands part of the United Kingdom, yet in the enjoyment of target 2 funding has come. But the report before the House tonight is a classic example that if we are not careful, developing ideas that sound like fantasy, for the citizens that will directly benefit from them, but no. U. of little relevance to. 
The report itself is well intentioned, it lacks, however, as many of our activities in this area on a clear purpose and a sound basis for its implementation in practice. My group and I therefore propose three major changes and additions before, that we water down the proposal in any way, but with which we intend to increase its relevance for those to whom it should serve as a guide. Let me explain this. We are concerned first with the proper use of funds from the structure - and the Cohesion Fund. Past experience shows that we should demand as the elected representatives of the European tax payer financial probity and transparency in the disbursement of these funds and related audit, indeed must. With our changes and additions we want to achieve what can be used in the administration of grants as an indicator of the most economical solution. Second, all too often huge sums being spent on projects whose outcomes will be estimated at the beginning of the period simply not yet clear. And stay out of the hoped-for success, there is no effective way, the project at halftime or at the end of this period actually exit. With our additions, we therefore demand that practical and enforceable ways of dropping out can be provided from a program with which we protect ourselves against not only other costs that are often at the expense of the taxpayer, but is prevented by including that, as in the past done so often, money is wasted. Finally, we call a change to the balance and method of disbursement. Should the private sector, through which the element of financial reality is introduced in the financing considerations are integrated. 
Nor should one shift in the types of projects for funding the focus from small-scale revenue based projects, which are hard to monitor, on an investment project for which the benefit is open in most cases is obvious. This one will satisfy the calls for more transparency in the use of funds, and the temptation of the local tax revenue in areas where such projects are implemented, unnecessary to charge for a long time, successfully countered. Parliament also makes clear how seriously it takes the call for such reforms. These changes, they should now be adopted by this House, in my view, are another crucial step towards achieving the historic goals for which the funds were originally set up in a financially sustainable support of the disadvantaged areas in the European Union, must be raised in the standard of living not by charity but by giving to a decent level. I urge the House to approve those changes. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her with so much hard work and diligence report prepared. Undoubtedly, the Structural policies and cohesion policy of the European Union are the main instruments to create the conditions for the growth and reduce economic and social imbalances in the regions. Despite the recent measures, these levels are still very high, with respect to unemployment are unacceptably high. With the goals of these policies can be implemented as widely as possible, they must be coordinated and implemented on the basis of well thought out and sensible guidance. Let us not forget that these policies if they are effective, and for the European citizens can see that by directly improving their quality of life! Consider also that the merit islands and remote regions of the European Union's special attention, for on the basis of their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development - unless the Commission intends to build bridges or underwater tunnels to linking them to mainland Europe. 
Let me say in conclusion that the structural policies as a whole require flexibility to meet the changing circumstances and that new challenges and opportunities arising from the new millennium, for which we all hope the best with it. Mr. President, the Schroedter report undoubtedly contains many important observations, and I congratulate them. However, we should let the direction and outcome of regional policy to be more concerned. Quite briefly some problems of mass unemployment is not degraded, not just taking in the context of structural policy aggravates it. Agriculture and agricultural regions have been by the existing regional policy irreparable damage, which has had dramatic consequences for rural employment and living conditions of farmers, particularly in the south. Regional disparities within Member States are becoming much way. Using data from the sixth report shows that regional disparities have increased significantly over the last ten years. The enormous problems of island regions of the Union, where the deficiencies in infrastructure, transport, communications and energy to a gradual depopulation result is almost no or no attention at all. This situation is caused both by the regional - and social policy of the Union - and by the economics. Broad population of the Union strongly condemned this policy as dangerous and unpopular. 
Unfortunately, the new guidelines is in the same direction, and nothing suggests that their implementation will change that. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! Let me say here a few brief words to highlight two points to remember these reports and in the idea we have of the Union to play a key strategic role. The first is the fundamental and central importance we attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion remains. We are concerned to hear news that we see that the importance of this objective in the views of the Commission less seriously. We are still of the view that the economic and social cohesion is a central objective of the Union. Secondly, I agree with what I have already heard from a colleague on the issue of the islands and I would also draw attention to the outermost regions. In the future we would welcome more courage in dealing with the subject of the most remote location, such as applies in the case of my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira. I take this opportunity to ask if we can educate the Commission about the reasons for the delay in the Commission report on the outermost regions, which is expected in Parliament for some time. Mr. President, First, my thanks to the rapporteur, also for being willing to include the suggestions we made in the report. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner But guides are available to the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives in the programs. 
The relevant requirements of the Commission shall, however, contrary to its claim to provide orientation, but a catalog of possible measures under the various policy areas. to give direction and set priorities, but its real meaning. I agree with the Rapporteur that the Commission document is unfortunately not enough recommendations to Member States for administrative simplification, and the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favorable climate for labor-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises, a clear target for alternative funding sources, including rules for venture capital and private financing, and on start-up assistance, including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields. My special support of a proposed amendment to paragraph 10 of my group, the appropriate involvement of the private sector in planning and implementation of the projects. I would love Schroedter if you would include this proposed amendment in the light of subsidiarity in your positive deliberations. Mr President, Commissioner, The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we represented the unanimous view that the support of the operations of the structure - and Cohesion Fund in favor of better employment opportunities for the unemployed and equality between men and women are of strategic importance and priority. Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report is not considered, although there is ample evidence - as we shall see later in the report Berend - how these funds to help the less developed regions really excellent, the distance between them and the most developed to bridge regions of Europe. They grow, but in terms of GDP. Increase their competitiveness, but the increase in wealth, not all, because the number of jobs does not increase and there are still differences in employment opportunities in the regions. Commissioner, you read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and treat it as a priority, because this is the big problem of the citizens. 
Please take account of the check is in the allocation of resources, strategic requirements for the job, because this, ultimately, is what the structure - require and cohesion funds. Mr. President, the guidelines must be designed to the programs of the important five years from 2002 to 2006 align properly and increase their efficiency so that objectives such as sustainable development and employment promotion, especially for women and young people, finally a reality and balance between economic - and social - and environmental policy is maintained. Particularly important to address those serious issues in the urban areas, employment security in rural areas, promotion of agricultural regions and of course - as provided for in Article 158 of the Treaty - the equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union, of course, to the Greek, the half of the islands of the Union. Cohesion policy must be strengthened further, for a Europe with a considerable gap in living standards between the regions neither credible nor can it endure. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! I have their versions, patches of your criticisms and suggestions in connection with the report of the Schroedter attentive and listened with great interest. We all, Mrs, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time, the delays - I'm coming out to speak. But today we are debating the report, which is present for me and the Commission at the right time, given that the 2000 guidelines - is 2006 and we just start with the new regional programming. Schroedter, you have rightly pointed out that it is essentially the role of the Member States and regions to set their own development priorities. But because of the co-financing of programs by the European Union it is necessary and right that Community priorities are taken into account as they are debated and approved in order to promote this collaborative aspect of economic and social cohesion, to which many of you with emphasis have remembered. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly discuss the meaning and structure of the guidelines before I come to speak to the comments or criticisms that you have submitted Schroedter, or you, ladies and gentlemen. With regard to the role and structure of the Guidelines have the committee chairman Hatzidakis, the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy recalled that the guidelines have the purpose of the national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategies for Objectives 1, 2 and 3 of the Structural Funds and to support their links with the Cohesion Fund. The idea is to set out the priorities of the Commission, based on past experience in implementing the programs, as well as the current Community policies related to the structural measures. 
These priorities are - as called here several times - to the better use, contribute optimal and efficient use of community interventions, this may also be necessary to reserve capacity, Mr Bradbourn, in particular, has the objective of ensuring optimal and efficient use of public funds in Europe . And when I speak of optimum use, I mean both the national and regional level, and, Mr Seppänen, at the national level, I mean the connection to the Cohesion Fund. This is the purpose of the guidelines. In regard to the content you know, ladies and gentlemen, that posed on three strategic principles to which the rapporteur in her presentation just clearly and emphatically reminded simultaneously. The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economy in order in all sectors, but particularly in the private sector, as Mr Berend, as many full and to create permanent jobs, economic competitiveness of regions, all regions, particularly of Wales, Mr. Evans, but not only for Wales. I would add, because there are some who have just pointed out, as this claim has been forgotten after apparently, the regional economies of the handicapped by their distance European regions - that is, the peripheral regions, the island regions and of course the regions most remote location. In this connection I wish to comment on the remarks of Mr Ribeiro i Castro and tell him that the Commission - as I have written to the respective presidents of the regions most remote location - has asked for a few weeks time extension for submitting its report. The communications of the various governments of the regions most remote location, we have received quite late, but is no excuse, just an explanation to be. It is now important to consider these documents and carefully evaluated. On 23 November I attended a meeting of representatives of the regions most remote location, and we agreed in the Commission that we need several more weeks to produce a report that the very serious and important issues, and the expectations of these outermost regions is just, thank you for your understanding. 
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness at the regional level. The second priority, which of you have repeatedly, in particular by Mr Puerta - I'm not in any event from a ranking of priorities among themselves - is the strengthening of social cohesion and employment, and in the future, especially human resources better should be funded. Ladies and gentlemen, in cases where one has to be in the European Union, the differences between states have declined - which speaks in the rest of the Cohesion Fund and its efficiency - but at the same time in unemployment - as the rapporteur writes - the differences grown between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest and most disadvantaged regions, this is a situation that is justifiable and intolerable. Because my understanding of the structure of Europe and regional development policies in particular, I think this is a situation that I can not accept. I intend, in the best of my ability and with your support funds for which I am responsible to use to meet the social, human and territorial cohesion, to prevent it, as I mentioned before this house, a two-speed Europe is a Europe of wealthy districts and a Europe of impoverished areas. The third objective is urban and rural development in a balanced regional development policy. The guidelines are based on the remaining two horizontal principles: the development of rural areas - and the question of a sustainable transport structure, rapporteur, to me is long on heart, especially since my time as environment minister of my country belongs to me in the area the development of rural areas - and the second principle is equality of opportunity, particularly between women and men, as well as the European Employment Strategy and the economic - and monetary union. Mrs, ladies and gentlemen, to your views expressed in the debate concerns, I would say that in the guidelines on the meaning and definition of integrated development - is made or conversion strategies so that these priorities to maximize synergy of the actions and effective decentralized partnerships allow. Are you worried because of this partnership was apparently not received. However, it is mentioned on page 5 of this guidance very clearly, and I would remind you - because they have asked me this - that this partnership for me - and I have long cared enough region to assess whether this is - a very effective vehicle for mobilizing the intellectual resources at the local level - both those in the public sector - the city - and city councils, the educational and social areas, clubs and associations - as well as those of the private sector. And the territorial pacts are to respond to a comment made by Ms Angelilli, one of the forms of decentralized partnership. The guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since in the context of the individual objectives to varying degrees depending on the specific situation of each Member States and regions can be considered. 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly discuss some of the comments first on the procedure. It is true that your house has been seized with the matter until late. But I would remind you that when the guidelines had been by the Commission in draft form in February 1999 adopted by a new process in which the submission of comments on the text has been simplified to them from my predecessor, Mrs Monika Wulf - Mathies, were immediately forwarded to Parliament. However, due to the then forthcoming elections could your house until after the final adoption of the text in July 1999 with the examination of the guidelines. Today I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen assure that we are in negotiations about the programs only at the beginning - the Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - and that, your observations in most Member States can be considered actually . Further, I can tell you that the Commission's opinion of your home, which is used in this report expressed will consider the adoption of guidelines for the prescribed so-called mid-term review. Now possible content of the guidelines. Mrs, you pointed out, that there comes a series of often very precisely defined European target to make. I can not list them all: the introduction of cross-sectoral measures, more efficient use of public funds in support of different partners in the joint development of regional or national programs, etc. The Commission takes note of this, but are these requirements or questions on the part not here but for example in the Vademecum or methodological document. Finally, rapporteur would like to concentrate myself on some thoughts of your report. 
I think for example of the statement that the guidelines in their recommendations are not sufficiently specific. This statement needs to be seen from the perspective of the negotiations last spring. The Commission has complied with the provisions of Article 10 of the General Regulation, the guidelines are broad, indicative guidelines on the relevant and agreed Community policies "defined. That was right after the wording of the regulation cited - in quotation marks. And guidelines are not a substitute for the programming or the ex - ante - ratings that are used to determine the priorities and the effectiveness of the programs. You then mentioned, Mrs, from the point regarding "guidelines for development in rural and urban areas" that will address the urban development only in passing. It seems to me that quite the opposite is true. I can confirm to you that the Commission's cohesion policy attaches great importance to the urban dimension and also attach in the future. Indeed, I had occasion recently to the authorities responsible for urban development ministers at a meeting in Tampere. In rural development, which has been mentioned here several times, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines referred to by the rapporteur twofold: a strong agricultural sector with improved competitiveness in rural areas, but also environmental protection and maintenance of rural heritage. 
This will be noted, however, that these guidelines, of which we speak, will only affect the structural funds, allow the objectives 1 and 2, particularly for rural diversification priority. As for that balance in rural areas, we must not forget here the new policy of rural development, co-financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section. It has the aim of the reform of European agriculture and promote the multi-functionality in agriculture. Today, I would say is that I wish that this item will be included in the programming of rural Objective 2 areas, as is the EAGGF Guidance Section in Objective 1 regions of the case. In any case, I realized that your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will continue to monitor this aspect carefully. Before I conclude, I would say to Mr Savary nor that tomorrow will provide a separate debate on the impact of storms in recent weeks, particularly in France, Austria and Germany and that is also the opportunity tomorrow, with my colleague from the Palacio de the oil spill in France to speak conclusions to be drawn. I will limit myself now permit, sir, you know my views, which in large part with your assessment, what we can achieve with Objective 2 for the control of the oil slick covers. I note that the Commission will confirm tomorrow the Objective 2 regional maps for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg. We will be a tool at their disposal, which we can apply in particular in the majority of people affected by the storms departments. For this reason I intend to tomorrow in two French departments of travel, which had suffered from the storms especially strong. Finally - thank you, Mr President, for your understanding - I want you, Mrs, thank you for your report, you and your committee did a good job. 
Apart from some differences of opinion regarding the role of the guidelines - we have talked about it and I tried to explain to you my position - I am very happy about how your house to draw up such guidelines to help Member States to prepare their own programs, supports . This encourages us to hold fast to our concept, based on a set of best practices from the current programming period 1994 / 1999. I think this is the beginning of the program 2000 / 2006 for a good omen for both of our institutions, for a confirmation of our joint work, Lord, backed up by the code of conduct that binds our two institutions and its adherence to my heart is , is strengthened. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 clock. Socio - Economic Situation and Development of the Regions The next item is the debate on the report (A5 - 0107 / 1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the socio - economic situation and development of regions of the European Union (SEC ( 99) 0066 - C5 - 0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 (COS)). Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen! This sixth periodic report on the socio - economic situation and development of regions of the European Union marks a new milestone in the analysis of regional data and makes clear since the publication of the fifth periodic report of progress made. I am of the opinion that one of the real situation is not quite fair when we speak of a real convergence of average regional levels of development in Europe. Unfortunately, this is often the message in the press and in some speeches. The report of the Commission puts this observation, especially when, it the socio - economic situation describes certain regions which are particularly dear to me. I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the outermost regions. 
I am pleased that the Committee for Regional Policy, one of my amendments adopted, which calls on the Commission to include in its next report, a separate chapter on cohesion in areas most remote location, an analysis of the effect of the measures shortly under new Article 299, paragraph 2 of the Amsterdam Treaty are met. The Sixth Periodic Report also contains terms of the objective of balanced and sustainable development in Europe, some interesting arguments, especially where it refers to the importance of relations between the center of Europe and its periphery. Even if the Commission is reluctant even to explicitly noted, the periodic report shows just how urgent a polycentric development of the Community area by means of a structural policy of the Union and in the context of the ESA - approach is. Mr. President, The Group of the Party of European Socialists in the Parliament with the report presented by Mr Berend agreed and congratulated the author, both for the quality of his conclusions on his flexibility, could be absorbed through the amendments in committee of the various factions. It must be remembered that the global competitiveness of the European Union to achieve at present 81% of the level of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if they are our competitive units, that is the regions, improved, and to a time when technological development, globalization of the economy and our problems, enlargement and the single currency, the Regions, as well as businesses and individuals require greater effort to be competitive. The Sixth Report of the European Commission very valuable conclusions. I would like to summarize two of them briefly, the rapporteur has already, one positive and one negative. The first relates to the fact that significant progress has been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and the Community Fund, an important, if not decisive, factor in reducing regional disparities. The negative is that the great effort made in the alignment of the GDP and productivity of European regions have a greater effect than the approximation of their level of employment. It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation. 
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period. Thus, Mr. President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and, as other speakers before me, I would ask the Commission to the conclusions of its Sixth Report in relation to the planning of the period 2000 - 2006 just to . consider Mr. President, Commissioner I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and having taken due account of the proposed amendments during consideration in committee. The sixth periodic report is a good basis for assessing the implementation of regional policy objectives in the EU and shows that despite all efforts, the growth has been uneven pulls. The regions of Central Europe, continues to be a particularly rapid growth that occurs in the strong economic centers at a pace that is above the European average, while many southern European and northern areas are developing more slowly. We now require a thorough analysis of why regional policy is not all areas have the desired effect. Is it the bureaucracy or the differences between regions, long distances, very cold or hot climate, low population density and austere conditions were not sufficiently taken into account? How can the Union, the challenges of global development in a way, keep up that even the less developed regions? Also important, the impact of enlargement on the Structural Funds and the development of the areas should be examined in the outermost regions. Here, Member States must also their responsibility. 
Some countries have violated the principle of subsidiarity and cut the national average for the regions, while the regional Union aid was increased. This was at the expense of regional policy. In the future, must be given to establishing a list of indicators that can be targeted by the measures in time for the right place. For example, uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently considered. Also in this context, the crucial importance of small and medium-sized businesses will be highlighted as an engine for employment and regional development. Very important is the introduction of modern technology and the latest know - how in companies in developed regions. Our group supports the adoption of this report. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! To date it has not been in the regional policy of the European Community, the substantial difference in the pro - bring power to the significant expression - head. The situation is serious because there is nowadays in the European Union established a clear relationship between unemployment and poverty, as the very worrying fact shows that the unemployment rate reached by this issue in the most affected regions on average 23.7%, and this regions coincide with areas of poverty, while in the 25 regions with lower unemployment, which correspond to the wealthy areas, unemployment stands at just 4%. emerge Given this situation, from the report that the Parliament adopts clear that measures are necessary, which are clearly directed towards the fight against relative poverty and unemployment. Measures such as adequate for the purposes of the Structural Funds, which are often used improperly, with central government policies, the modernization of the telecommunications and communications by particular aim of integrating the least developed regions, due in 2007 in trans-European railway networks, the consideration and development of agriculture - and resources and capacities of these countries, which are often harmed by insensitive policies the European Union, the promotion of active employment policies, particularly for women and young people. 
Only with the consistent implementation of such measures, it will be possible to overcome social and regional inequality, is not the historical product of inherent weaknesses, but of marginalization and economic policies with adverse effects. Mr President, Commissioner, This report follows Mr Berend exactly the set by the European Commission's strategy, by the issue of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore. The overarching objectives of the Structural Funds, such as greater employment, greater equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are mentioned only in passing. This view seems unwarranted, and I would also ask that these points come in the seventh periodic report much more evident. This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, more so than I myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 1 area, in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and well aware of the concerns and needs of small - and medium-sized company know. In Objective 1 regions are temporary measures in parallel, imperative, namely, job creation programs, special programs to promote employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business. They are supported by appropriate activities from the Structural Funds of the European Union. Supporting only the competitiveness of firms can compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development never easy because no basis for a self-sustaining recovery in these Objective 1 regions. And the experience that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment among substantiates the fact that it takes at least 3% increase in gross national product in order to create any additional jobs. The exclusive focus on demand-driven, supply-side economics is not the answer. 
And if that do pursue, you have to largely invest in expansion and less rationalization. It is imperative with a demand-oriented economic policy if we are to have any chance of improving the social situation in these areas. In the regions, these situations are very, very different. That means it needs is a number of accompanying measures to make there anything at all. That would, for example, measures for vocational training, further education, the reintegration of people who have already been excluded from the production process, develop the flexibility of working hours and working practices in order to bring decision personal and social aspects more consistent and perhaps also the to promote women's employment again. Mr. President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for his detailed report. The Structural Funds is essentially the economic and social cohesion between the regions of the European Union can be improved. With the help of various kinds of investment incentives sought by the European Union for an increase in GDP per capita and to growth in employment. From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can cautiously conclude that these incentives do not always have the desired effect. To the increase in per - lead GDP in Objective 1 regions oriented efforts are not always to this growth - head. Not really a satisfying result in a time that, especially in recent years, was marked by an economic boom. 
As the rapporteur, the employment effects of structural measures is hardly felt. I therefore consider it appropriate to exercise in evaluating the effectiveness of Community aid posture. The finding that the differences between regions in the Member States sometimes even raises serious questions. To me it is therefore appropriate and necessary to our attention, just when it comes to employment incentives, both at the national and the regional authorities sent. Just know it yet, the regions in their area best. By developing customized programs for the respective regions and, if necessary, to financial aid, can achieve a larger effect. And that's the point eventually. I therefore welcome it if the Commission on the practical details and the implementation of measures to the Member States and regions. It is in this context anyway surely make more sense to put at the financial aid to regions more weight on the Member States. By shifting the criteria of the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a lot of future problems. 
Finally, I would like the position of the medium - to point and Eastern European countries. As is evident from the report, they usually have, especially in terms of per - capita - GDP, a long way behind the countries of the European Union. In view of a large number in the foreseeable future, the planned accession of these countries I think it is very urgent to review the current structure of policy. Like many others, I urge the Commission to present proposals for reform sooner. Dear Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner After close scrutiny of this report one can not doubt the conclusion that the stated objective of the structural policy was only partly fulfilled. Thus, among others, the disparity between the regions rather - as accepted by Member States themselves in this a certain approach. Similarly, unemployment levels in the most affected regions are barely fell, in part, they are even increased. So I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not used efficiently. Even the accumulation of funds from the Cohesion Fund and the structural funds has not in all regions and countries have the desired effect. After Europe, the goal of all politicians to reduce unemployment, one must put the critical question of whether the policy is right or whether it is appropriate to the competitiveness of the regions by measures including increased support for research and development, improvement the infrastructure and raising the level of training 
Serious structural reforms and a pro-competitive tax - and tax policy are the cornerstones of a successful business location. If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a costly structural policy on the issue of employment does nothing long term, the actions taken must be questioned. Successful structural policy of the Union if it is possible to create sufficient jobs and the unemployment rate drops significantly. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I thank the rapporteur for the treatment of this very important topic. The development of social and economic situation will determine how citizens evaluate the success of our work in Europe. For the credibility of the EU, the problems that people have on their everyday life, are of crucial importance. We must admit that the EU development in poorer countries already - has supported - I believe that even very generous. If I think I remember how it looked in Portugal and Greece, as I traveled this country 25 years ago for the first time, I take my hat off to the EU or, as the French say: "coup de chapeau". The EU has earned that respect really. In the countries themselves, but there are still large differences between poor and rich regions. What are the consequences? 
People react by voting with their feet and leave their homes. So we have to build for the same people the same country many times schools, hospitals and the entire infrastructure. This is a very expensive affair and also leads to major social problems. Most people would like to remain living where they are born if they would offer the possibility of doing so if they had work. We must give them this opportunity. It is a moral obligation to the EU and all of us have. One solution I see clearly encouraging entrepreneurship. I mean, however, not only to own a company, but the will to run a business. I mean the attitude that causes people to move forward in life, whether as employees, entrepreneurs or officials. What does a just society? 
It is a society in which someone can move from a modest background, so that his children a little easier. This gives the possibility of a positive development of the regions, because the people involved and will work if they are given the chance. Finally, I would like to point out that we should learn this from America, where hard work is still in fashion, and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as is the case here in Europe is often the case. Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen! Since my very little time is available, I'll be right down to business. First, an observation: The fruits of growth are not equitably distributed within the Union. One example is the outermost regions, where unemployment still has dramatic proportions. In Reunion, the unemployment rate as 37%. This situation is not cyclical but structural. It arises because of our remoteness, our insularity, short, our own creates this situation. To remedy this, in Article 299 paragraph 2 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the principle of a specific exception handling has been provided. Now it is time to put this principle into practice. 
The announced for December 1999 Document of the Commission was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking makes me not optimistic. I therefore appeal to the Council and the Commission. As regards taxation, state aid, Structural Funds, the protection of domestic production is needed urgently concrete, bolder and more ambitious measures. Otherwise remain convergence and cohesion words for us, and it is feared that the structural policies undertaken in our region despite the high end means used in failure. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 clock. (The meeting closed at 20.25 clock.) Approval of minutes of previous meeting The minutes of the last meeting have been distributed. 
Are there any objections? Mr. President, I hereby corresponded by the President of the House yesterday afternoon expressed request, on behalf of my group to comment on the matter mentioned in the minutes position. I refer to paragraph 11 of the work plan. First, I believe by the chairman of the Socialist Group submitted a proposal for the resumption of the debate with the President of the Commission on the strategic program for the next five years as a result of the fact that other speakers would have liked expressed briefly to had enough weight so that he should have been met. I want to make that clear, even if I have expressed myself with all due respect, however, and voted against the proposal of the Chairman of the Socialist Group. The second point would take me - and I would have liked to met yesterday before the vote - concerns of this Parliament, which, as several MPs yesterday found, only then can really achieve something if it works closely with the European Commission and appropriate synergies exploited. We should view muster the humility that we can not set up until a week before the actual debate in this House, the mechanisms necessary to carry out a strategic debate, which is not limited to a presentation and remarks by the President of the Commission is limited, but presented in a five-year program. The only way we can communicate to the Commission in time our wishes and discuss them accordingly. I would like that we will learn the basic teachings. If future important debates on specific issues pending between the House and the European Commission, we should clarify at least a full working month in advance who has what expectations. First, clarity between the groups in this house there and then between the House and the Commission. 
It may not happen, that this or that institution strained relations between the institutions in the last minute unnecessary. When I look at some press reports from last Friday, look, I have the impression that the Commission and its president in its public statements have been holding back in a praiseworthy way. For this I am deeply grateful to them. I hope that we draw our lessons and have avoided this unnecessary exercise in the future, based on a misunderstanding of my view in regard to our mutual expectations and no bad faith on one or the other institution was. We should not exaggerate the whole thing on. Thank you, Mr. Cox! I understand what you mean. We have taken note. Mr. President, I am referring to paragraph 11 of the Protocol on the work plan. We agreed yesterday to put the report Bourlanges on the agenda of today. The report was discussed last night, but by the Budget Committee was not yet voted on. 
It must therefore be discontinued from today's agenda. Mr. Wynn, which is logical. The report had been withdrawn from the agenda. Mr. President, I am referring to what Mrs Lynne said yesterday on health and safety in this building. I assume that she meant to sanitation, according to which there is a smell in the fifth floor of the tower very strong. This must necessarily something to be done, because the smell clearly indicate that something is amiss. I do not want to harp endlessly on this subject, but we are dealing here with a serious problem. Mrs. Ahern, we have taken note. I would ask this particular issue, which relates to fans in a particular floor, to the attention of the Bureau, because they are actually responsible. We will not give the well to our services. Thank you! 
(The House approved the protocol.) Reform of European Competition Policy According to the agenda the debate on the following reports: A5 - 0069 / 1999 by Mr von Wogau on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission White Paper (COM (1999) 101 - C5 - 0105 / 1999 - 1999 / 2108 (COS)) on the modernization of the rules implementing Article 85 and 86 of the EC - Treaty; A5 - 0078 / 1999 by Mr Rapkay on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs XXVIII. Report of the Commission (SEC (1999) 743 - C5 - 0121 / 1999 - 1999 / 2124 (COS)) on Competition Policy 1998; A5 - 0087 / 1999 by Mr Jonckheer on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the seventh report of the Commission (COM (1999) 148 - C5 - 0107 / 1999 - 1999 / 2110 (COS)) on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (Report 1995 - 1997); A5 - 0073 / 1999 by Mr Long on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission report (COM (1999) 94 - C5 - 0104 / 1999 - 1999 / 2107 (COS)) on the application of its decision no. 2496 / 96 / ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for aid to the steel - and steel industry (Steel Aid Code) in 1998. Mr President, Commissioner, Ladies and gentlemen! We have today an important debate on Competition Policy of the European Union. We talk about a very controversial modernization projects in the European antitrust law, namely the report of Wogau, and that is much more controversial than it has been perhaps the vote considerably in the economic committee. I will definitely say that I personally, in this particular case, the proposal believe that the Commission is wrong, that turn out to be yet to whether the term is justified modernization for the content of the White Paper on Article 81 and 82 really or not in this case rather regression of the appropriate term would be. 
We are talking about today but also aid the report and the general competitiveness report for 1998, which relates to my part in this joint debate in the latter area. But both reports - the competition report and review of the aid - of course, have a common base line in this White Paper. It's about the right of modernization, the future viability of European competition policy. If you read both of Commission documents was so in 1998 a year in which continued the modernization project, initiated in 1997 and in part, been completed, we know from our own current parliamentary work. Let me make two general observations: the Commission as the competent authority is consistent with their stance again and again earned the freedom to compete, not always to the delight of the Member States or companies. You should continue this way. But, Mr. Commissioner, this is not all will be less complicated - I only remember the challenge of enlargement, the deepening of the internal market, technological advances, globalization. It all depends not only on the modernization of Community law, it is more important than ever on transparency of individual decisions on the possibility of decisions can follow as well as European competition policy on the acceptance of the population and the affected governing bodies and to rely on the businesses concerned. But - without transparency no acceptance, and then also no modernization without transparency. The Competition Report 1998 is not a bad basis for that, but there is just nothing that is not to make it even better. 
A number of suggestions we will, Mr Commissioner, give to our resolution, but one aspect I will now go before: transparency and accountability together. I will not compromise on the division of powers between the Commission and Parliament. The Commission is the executive and Parliament should own for the sake of independence and do not be, but Parliament is the controlling body, and where to better explain his reasons for decisions as the democratically elected parliament and even in a permanent parliamentary discourse ? Again, we should continue on its path, it perpetuate and intensify. One but I will say quite clearly: Parliament legislators, that we have but just for competition law only consultation rights, which is really a scandal! Here is the call on the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the co-decision procedure in the competition law. Of the Commission, I expect all the possibilities of parliamentary involvement until the final consequence can be exploited in doubt for the participation of Parliament, and even at the current contract situation. I also expect that the Commission will help us offensively when asking for the co-decision in the legislative process. This will be a test case for the proper cooperation of both institutions. For all their commitment to the principle of competition is competition, but to no end in itself. 
Competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions. It is now time for the basic economic knowledge that the market fails in many ways, and who denies that is an ideologue, nothing else. Competition is to match supply and demand for compensation is to provide an optimal distribution of economic resources and facts. Optimum efficiency is, however, not necessarily by itself. Conditions are essential for the prevention of abuse, such as by antitrust law. But this will substantially prevent abuse only, not it is good by itself to achieving socially legitimate targets. Competition yes, restriction of aid where necessary and where possible! But since taking aid in the Competitiveness Report 1998 the main part, I will, without prejudice to the report of Mr Junker, but still say something about this: aid to small and medium-sized enterprises in research and development, to training in regional policy, environmental policy that is quite possible and must be feasible. Aid must be allowed for just such goals as long as they do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition. Right here it is more important than in the cartel - and merger law that decisions are understandable. 
Aid are not just in the pillory, and must be considered separately, they must be judged on their contribution to achieving the aforementioned goals. The final point was less to the Commission, but rather to the colleagues of the EPP - directed group. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! The report that I can present you today is to comment on the annual report on state aid in the European Union, which, under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the contracts within the competence of the Community. The report of the Commission, essentially descriptive character and describes the development of state aid in the manufacturing and certain other sectors of different types, such as the manner of financing and goals. As regards the quantitative aspect of the report, I would refer to the reasoning and here only necessary to state that the average annual total for the period moves in the order of 95 billion euros, a decrease of about 13% over the period 1993-1995 equivalent, which is mainly due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany. In plain language this means that the average level of aid in the reporting period, on the whole is stable, at about 1.2% of EU GDP, that happens to be more or less the budget of the Community for a year is. The differences among countries can be measured in a variety of ways, such as percentage of value added per person employed, however, are considerable. It would be interesting in my opinion, add to, state aid and community interventions that can be assimilated in a way state aid. Then it becomes quite clear that the four countries that receive, among other things by the Cohesion Fund, are in first place. Let me now turn to the proposal was part of the report. 
First of all, that the Commission considers the annual report of the Commission presented data are aggregated to strong to allow a thorough assessment of state aid policy. This is for a legitimate and a sensitive point with regard to national interests, but also more important with regard to compliance with competition law and under the Treaty. The Commission can only collect and analyze the data that you are passed by the Member States. It is the responsibility of states and regions to ensure the quality of the data, and from the perspective of our committee for this purpose, additional efforts are needed. In the same spirit of our parliamentary committee advocates the already old idea of a public register of state aid that would be available mainly through Internet. The availability of better and more detailed information in particular on the objectives and the observed results, it would enable the European Commission to carry out regular studies on the socio-economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies or to be carried out. In the degree that some of these studies already exist, they could make known their own comments in the light of the objectives of the contracts, which include in addition to securing the competitiveness of European industry and the sustainable development and economic and social cohesion, more comprehensive. We have at our debate in committee and in the report that I present to you the honor to put the quality of the information to the forefront and we refrain from any simplification, which would have been to say a priori that State aid to be in absolute terms either too high or not high enough. The committee members were mostly likely try to between the need to adhere to states and companies, the competition rules, on the one hand and the recognition of the importance of such aid as a contribution to the objectives of the Treaty, in particular, as I said, sustainable in the areas of produce development, research and development and economic and social cohesion on the other hand, a balance. On this basis, the Committee decided several amendments to the original draft report. Emphasis was placed on the need to recover the actual as-assessed unlawfully aid and to create a list of the results. Seven changes are proposed this session again. 
They reflect most of our different political views on the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, given the inadequacies of private investment, market failures or market gaps. I want to emphasize that strikes me as rapporteur as primarily a proposal to change energy policy is particularly important. Let me conclude by referring the one hand, a concern of the committee members and also to a demand of our committee, Commissioner. The concern relates to the pre-accession process of Central - and Eastern European countries from the perspective of competition policy and state aid. We do it because undoubtedly a complex issue and would wish that the Commission informed us about the current state, especially the ability of the economies of the accession countries to comply with competition rules and in terms of state aid, about the need the likelihood that special rules are established for state aid to support the restructuring of the sectors have to. The call finally concerns the future powers of the European Parliament in here are talking about areas of competition policy and state aid with a view to the IGC. In our report, as you know, represented Commissioner, the idea that should apply to the adoption of basic legal texts on state aid, the co-decision procedure. Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, my part in today's debate goes to the SAC. These are the public support in Europe, which were awarded under this Code and has reviewed the Commission. The total of 27 cases in 1998. On such cases, the Commission has issued its own report. The ECSC - contract will expire soon. 
Therefore, the question we must now employ, especially those who will continue as the steel aid handled. The decisions of the European Commission, which are outlined in the report are welcomed by the European Parliament, including the decision to recover funds in a given case and thus the article 88 of the ECSC - Treaty apply. The competitiveness of the European steel industry is at the same content of the recent Commission Communication, which we have not yet discussed in Parliament. As in other areas also applies to the iron - and steel industry, the general ban on state aid under Article 87 paragraph 1 of the EC - Treaty. The article also provides that aid in principle incompatible with the common market. Exceptions are allowed only in strictly defined cases. Under Article 88 the Commission on state aid control is required. In the year 1998 was the largest case the supply of equity to Preussag in Germany in the amount of 540 million ¬. In addition, Member States should communicate their aid before. In the area of the steel industry are the rules on 18 been set up in December 1996. 
After that, aid to the steel industry will be awarded only in certain specified cases. It is available for research - and development assistance, environmental assistance, social aid to facilitate the closing of steel plants and aid to final operational tasks of uncompetitive companies. There is also a special up to 50 million euros for the Member State Greece. Obviously there was the practical use of the SAC in recent years, however, issues that were not fully discussed in the report. From the perspective of the Parliament, it is important that today is already talking about a connection scheme after the expiry of the SAC. A relaxation of the existing code base lines of the steel should not be decided. No one wants a subsidy race unrestrained in Europe. This would affect the internal market after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years. Therefore, it holds necessary by the House that the steel subsidy code is modified with respect to the alleged unequal treatment by the industry and the Commission to the Council submitted a succession plan. It is known that the Council has so far refused to adopt such a succession. This is because we believe that when the steel aid code expires, you can again do without the annoying control by the European Commission, what you want. 
We therefore demand that must be settled after the expiry of the contract, the steel aid by a Council Regulation based on Article 94, because only then the necessary legal force and clarity possible. The strict ban on all aid that is not covered by the Code can only be enforced Sun A Council Regulation which is directly applicable law, must be observed also by regional governments. Adverse effects of competition and imbalances on the markets must be avoided in the future. criticism is the practice of the Commission to approve aid for multiple steel companies covered in its opinion, not under the categories of the Code, even if the European Court has endorsed individual decisions that inconsistency. In a yet to be compiled report for the year 1999, the Commission is invited to their active role in the development of restructuring plans and approved exceptions set out in detail and so on that basis to enable a proper assessment of the overall context. After the economic - and Monetary Committee draft report adopted unanimously with two abstentions, I ask that we meet in plenary this requirement, we have outlined, even here, in full. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! The internal market is not yet complete. Subsidies, monopolies and restrictive trade practices still inhibit the markets and the development. National governments grant subsidies and always promise that this was the last time, but it happens again and again. 
Subsidies distort the allocation of funds, both in the countries themselves and between them. The state aid should be phased out and more and more markets are opened to competition, both for the private and state monopolies applies. State monopolies are broken down only reluctantly. Greater competition and start-up companies, however, could bring great benefit to the welfare system - even in the field of public education, health and social services. State monopolies are replaced by competitive structures. Europe must be modernized and adapted to entrepreneurship and more competitive conditions for consumers and businesses. An effective competition leads to lower prices and higher living standards. Consumer policy is focused too little on the price level, but competition policy and consumer policy together. The single market is the basis of our work. The relevant legislation will apply to all equally, for both large and small countries. 
To reduce distortions of competition should national standards be reviewed systematically, and the laws of the EU require analysis. The tested now by the Commission new model may not lead to a pure nationalization process that already achieved would undermine competition policy. Its effective implementation requires a strong foothold in the national authorities of Member States. After half a year could be the results of a tracing analysis, but also the impact of the new situation on the Commission's role be investigated further. The question of how to proceed now is solved by the proposed cross-conference with representatives of various interest groups as a platform for a broad discussion initially unbiased. This is an excellent opportunity to establish new policies or return to the major changes discussed, to find new common solutions and to analyze the discussions in the committees put forward proposals for change. The application of the law on competition matters must be accurate. An incorrectly implemented competition policy may result in disqualification and impairment of the important and valuable principle of ownership. We have a very interesting debate before us. At a conference at which these issues are discussed, misunderstandings can be eliminated and possibly also some to be improved. 
The Parliament and the Commission can make together to contribute to an effective competition policy, creating new opportunities and resources that benefit its citizens. Especially in my constituency, Stockholm, there are many good examples of a wider range and improved quality, which were possible in that formerly monopolized areas have been replaced by competitive structures. We support the continuation of open debate, as manifested in the discussion of the reports of Wogau and Rapkay. We also cherish the hope that the legal aspects, the importance attached to them to play in a constitutional state. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! I am happy today as a new Member to but with a time delay, are allowed to hold my first speech here. First of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs of Wogau, Langen, Rapkay, Jonckheer and at the Commission for the very good cooperation. Competition is certainly the basis of the social market economy, and the European competition policy is a success story, most recently the energy and telecommunications, the appreciable at lower prices, resulting in better service. All for the benefit of the consumer. Now we are come to a point where we need to develop competition policy. Here, the Commission presented a new White Paper on two key points: departure from the reporting, shift back law enforcement. 
The shift away from the obligation anyway means less red tape and bureaucracy. This change in the system leads naturally to gain additional responsibility for the individual in the economy. It is not so easy to submit only and be approved, but now everyone must bear responsibility before anything else happens, and this is perhaps the reason that one or the others out there feel uncomfortable about it. But I think we should seize the opportunity that Europe can also set a mark for less bureaucracy. The second point is the relocation of law enforcement. To get a legal culture in Europe, the law must certainly not only by the Commission, shall be applied by central institutions, but also by national authorities, national courts. We also do not discuss the fact that each of the EU - the right decision is always central, but just in the adaptation phase, we will have legal uncertainty. It is certainly necessary in the expected legislative process to develop an instrument to ensure that the companies have legal certainty and here they have the opportunity to address the Commission. It should be kept open the road to a European Cartel Office, will certainly be discussed in the future. But we need more transparency in competition policy. 
Parliament must be involved, and I also think that when we introduce a register in which we can understand what State services are provided, this will lead to discipline in the Member States. I have received but for the future of the competition two points very important. One is the issue of subsidiarity. We all agree that competition is essential for the economy and to promoting efficiency, and I think we should also allow competition in the regions. The competition between the regions will certainly strengthen and not weaken the European Union. Here I would cite as an example the issue GA - promotion, the example of savings banks and regional banks, the sample label. Here is a region on its own has created something to market their own products. This initiative should not be destroyed by European level. I am sure that even an increase in the de - minimis - would be needed. We should do everything that is forced between the regions of the competition. 
The second is a discussion of competition and social market economy, of which I will not speak here of market failure. The country's banks and savings range I've indicated already, but now once I get to the point, what you often hear on one side or the other. A resident of a nursing home is now housed in the social sector. I it can also be seen as a customer, and I think we should discuss rather clearly and in time about where the social sector, where established structures mean a stop to competition. Otherwise, I can any customer to designate any area as a customer and thereby destroy very strong social sectors. Finally, I would say to the subsidiarity principle: I believe it is imperative that where Member States allow the regions and municipalities to levy taxes, it is maintained and is not uniform in Europe. Thank you, colleague. I congratulate you on what is called in German parliamentary system in your case improperly a maiden speech. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Robert Goebbels, who because of a political commitment unfortunately unable to attend. Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the report Jonckheer sharp controversy on the question of how the market has responded. 
A narrow right-wing majority has managed to remove from the report any reference to the shortcomings of the market. If our parliament majority follow this ultra-liberal concept of a supposedly perfect market, it would therefore not change the world yet. The economic relations in the real world make sufficiently clear that the elimination of all government intervention in the market by no means leads to a perfect competition and improve resource allocation. The market was indeed the preferred exchange place since time immemorial the people, but never perfect. The market gives priority to short-term business and quick profits. At the market, made the balance between supply and demand in the general detriment of the weakest - of consumers and workers. To function, the market needs rules. The necessary and valuable enterprise needs to balance the sense of responsibility towards society. We are as European social democrats for a social market economy. The market is not an end, he must serve the improvement of living conditions. 
The European Union, the States could not take the place of traders, but the authorities must set the rules and objectives that enable the economy to develop in a sustainable manner. Finally, aid may serve to facilitate restructuring, provide training, jobs and therefore know - how to save. The main objective of competition policy of the Union can not be to lower the overall level of aid. You have the aid of the objectives of the Union, particularly the economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and program research. The Commission has inappropriate aid, and those that actually hinder the internal market, announce the fight. It would be a grave mistake to abolish all state aid. The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research funded by the U.S. Army. The World Wide Web, the dizzying development of the information society has been made possible by the CERN in Geneva, also developed with government funding. The rescue of Holzmann - Group was supported by the German government criticized as being an unjustified obstacle to the market economy. President Duisenberg has even tried to give this state intervention to blame for the otherwise very relative weakness of the euro against the dollar. 
I am not aware that Mr Duisenberg, the rescue of the hedge fund LTCM by U.S. monetary authorities have been criticized. save 60 000 jobs to do, which is apparently a sin against the market, but the rescue of capital prepares the advocates of the free market seems to be no problems. Public funds are used to correct the damage caused by international speculation, as was done in Mexico, Asia and Brazil in the case. Human labor is seen as a simple contrast adjustment factor. We Socialists are opposed to this liberal glorification. We want a real competition culture in Europe. The hand of the States must remain visible in the control of the market, and the Commission takes the role of an arbitrator. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I would first like to thank Mr Rapkay for his good report and good cooperation. You, Commissioner Monti, I thank for the excellent cooperation, at the same time I would like to point out that you just at the turn of the century a particularly important role to play, because you have to iron out the mistakes of the national governments in relation to competition policy have big visions. For all the fantasy may be, however, the harm that they cause can hardly imagine. I can point to recent examples. 
We have the case of Holzmann. This company receives substantial aid from the German government, as well as sawmills in East Germany, and finally, the call for aid to the shipyards. In these areas, many Danish companies have problems, and remain in business. Mr. Poos, I would say that I agree with Mr. Duisenberg. There are examples of some European Member States are able to change their economic structure and thereby jeopardize the value of the euro. The Liberal group has submitted 80 amendments in committee, all aimed at dealing with state aid. These proposals do we believe in transparency and openness, for the functioning of the internal market is very important. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for their support of the proposals of the Liberal Group. If our proposals are, as I said, transparency, and I would like to draw your attention to the amendment in which the Commission will be asked to provide uniform criteria and conditions for legal aid, so the companies can assess their situation. There are also important to clarify what to do when state aid may be declared unlawful. How can we ensure that illegal state aid be repaid? Currently there are no common rules in this area and we urge the Commission to continue to ensure the harmonization of legislation to repay. 
This is the right way to create equal conditions of competition. We also propose, as mentioned by several colleagues already, before the register and a scoreboard, can be seen from what level the countries as having state aid. We have taken up Mr. Monti, your suggestion on the Scoreboard. This has inspired us to propose the same for state aid. I hope very much, Commissioner Monti, that you will support this proposal and I see their comments and your opinion forward. Finally, I welcome the XXVIII. Competition Commission report, which as with previous reports is a success. Our primary objective must, however, as I said, its transparency and openness. It implies further transparency and openness of state aid ever and focused our efforts to draw on these areas. This is important not least for the forthcoming enlargement. I would like to thank Mr. Jonckheer, which deals with the problems involved in his report very thoroughly. He examines how we can ensure that these countries are our requirements, but also how level playing field. Of course, Liberals and Greens are different views about how the world should be such, but we are related to largely agree on the goals and will try to be a reasonable solution to our problems. 
Mr President, Commissioner, we have easily answered two questions. If state aid to companies or agreements between companies in a market economy, legitimate, and who should control these exceptions to the absolute rules of market economy? On the first point, we state very clearly that if the demands of sustainable development as advocated by the European Union, should be taken into account, the company state aid should be granted, whether in the form of tax exemptions of differentiated taxation or simply of direct aid. As legitimate, it is also clear that there are agreements between companies or self-limiting agreements that make it possible to reduce the negative effects of competition in terms of social or environmental claims. We say so clearly and unequivocally, yes, it is legitimate that it gives aid and that there can be agreement, but we also say that each of these agreements must be explicitly justified. The report by Wogau is proposed to transfer the control of the legitimacy of such measures in the national responsibility. We see this indeed is some risk, but they still vote for it, because we recognize that the Commission can not do everything. We demand that this can take the utmost transparency and that the Commission more investigation powers be granted to review the legitimacy of exceptions after the fact. Mr. President, once again we are debating on Competition Policy of the European Union. But - under what conditions does this debate really is, and what conclusions should we draw? 
The current situation is characterized by huge mergers that take place, mergers and acquisitions giant monopolies and created worldwide frighteningly powerful corporations. Should not we really rather discuss it? Which competition policy can and will control these monopolies? Some European industries such as shipbuilding, aviation - and the steel industry are already offering competitive policies have become and have suffered considerable losses. They have lost positions and significant interests in the global market as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Whether we probably deal at some point once it? The shocking concentration of power in strategic sectors provides the economies of entire countries - by Member States of the Union - from the only target profit multinational corporations. Nevertheless, we urge further weakening the public sector and are ready to tighten up the competition policy still cheap even by government contracts to companies in the public sector as state aid. On the other hand, the dismantling of hundreds of thousands of jobs leads to a dramatic rise in unemployment. The employees find themselves the hitherto most massive attack on their collective agreements and social rights suspended. 
The consumer experience, their standard of living drops, poverty is rampant and the public sector and the productive base in most countries of the Union on behalf of an unrestrained and destructive competition in favor of full market economy and in the monopoly interests of big business will be ruined and dissolved . Partly responsible for this is our view, the practice of competition policy, against which we set ourselves resolutely to defend. Mr President, Commissioner, during these crucial years before the introduction of the single currency, the Commission has made every effort to create favorable conditions for the euro. This also includes competition policy has contributed under this facility. For our part, we remain strongly opposed to the single currency, which brings us no advantages and flexibility of a common currency, but we missed a straitjacket that is forced upon the peoples of Europe. To govern is to look ahead and indeed responsibility, and in this new context forced upon us, of course, plays an essential role of competition law. The Commission has set in this area several purposes: to influence the market structure through the active repression of anti-competitive practices, exclusive focus of the inspection activities of its departments on matters of common interest and a clear expression of their will to modernize the antitrust law. As regards state aid, it is important to ensure that this instrument is not too heavy. The introduction of a public register in which all aid would be covered, we think it desirable, for this expensive undertaking would not be automatically available to all attempts to reduce bureaucratic constraints. Finally, on the modernization of the application of Articles 85 and 86, we think it would, in a distributed application is not the right way. The Commission reserves the right not just a matter of competence of national authorities to withdraw, but national courts are clearly committed to avoid any conflict with the decisions of the Commission.
